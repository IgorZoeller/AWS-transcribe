 around. And we are taking a look at elastic beanstalk. Before we talk about what elastic beanstalk is, let's talk about what a platform as a services or a pass. A platform allows customers to develop, run and manage apps, without the complexity of building and maintaining infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. However, the trends these days is companies are actually building their own platforms on top of infrastructures of service. So I would say that I guess it's called platform engineering. And so that is becoming a lot more common. But before you used to just have a few passes out there, specifically for applications, like web web servers that people wanted to put up a very famous one was Heroku. I think Heroku still exists. Let me just double check that here. I'm just going into a different browser. So yeah, it's still there. But Heroku is not talked about as as much before because they had a free tier and they got rid of that. But yeah, I'll just like pull it over here. So we have Heroku over here. And this one started out because of Ruby on Rails. But then they expanded out to all these other ones. But it still is the easiest platform to deploy on. I think they got acquired. That's why and the and the free tier went away. And that's why people don't talk about them anymore. But the downside of platforms as a service is generally they can be more expensive than provisioning things yourself, because they're betting that you're you don't know how to configure an application. And so you're going to take advantage of that. However, cloud service providers were smart because they did not charge you more they just whatever you're using underneath is what you're charged for. So that's where things like Elastic Beanstalk, or for Azure, Azure apps, Azure apps, or Google's App Engine became good alternatives. They weren't as nice as Heroku. But people don't talk about Heroku that much anymore. I think render is a becoming a very popular one. But I'm not really sure as I don't need to pass I can just configure things myself. So anyway, proceeding forward here. So the idea here is that for Elastic Beanstalk, you choose a platform upload your code and it runs with little knowledge of the infrastructure. I don't believe that anymore. I feel that Elastic Beanstalk has become a lot more complex. And it's very difficult to get working nowadays without actually understanding the underlying components. Elastic Beanstalk is not recommended for production applications. And that is a devices recommendation. And I think they're just trying to tell that to enterprises who might expect expect that they get a certain level of support or functionality of it. Elastic Beanstalk can provision a lot of things for you. And you can do this all by yourself like without without using Beanstalk. But the idea is that if you don't know how to set up a load balancer, not a scaling group or database, or a bunch of other things, it can do a lot of the work for you there. And the idea is that you would go ahead and choose a platform, you could of course, deploy Dockerize containers. So this kind of competes with another service called app runner. So I would say that I used to really like Elastic Beanstalk. But as the years have gone by, the service is not going to not gotten better. In fact, it doesn't feel very well maintained, as there are some legacy components, like for instance, they still use launch configurations instead of launch templates. There is a service role that's supposed to be created for you. But now they don't do that. And so you have to create it manually. And it's very hard to get health checks. And I would just say overall, I do not recommend Elastic Beanstalk anymore. In fact, I tried to do labs re recording all of our labs for Elastic Beanstalk here. And I absolutely just became very frustrated with it. So I do have the new labs. But I got to tell you, we don't get the app working 100%. We do learn a lot doing the labs, but I'm going to keep the old labs from a few years ago, because that kind of shows you more of the deployment models when it successfully worked. And I think that if you were to watch those or even to attempt it yourself, then you'll get a lot of practical knowledge there. But I have enriched the lecture slides here to bring more of the code forward. So you know, if you don't get them to the labs, you'll get them the lecture slides. So just understand that there. Okay.
