 Let's talk about supported languages. And the idea is that you want to deploy something right. And generally, it's going to be for a very specific language and framework. And the idea is that you basically can pick that when you launch up a new elastic beanstalk environment. So for the most part, if you want to run rails, you're going to be doing Ruby, all the way down the board. And if you go into the database docs, you can see there, even though these are language specific environments, they have a lot of support around various common frameworks, I would say the best way to run Docker or sorry, a beanstalk is in a Docker container, specifically a single Docker container. But you know, it's up to you how you want to utilize it. But it has very robust support across languages. When you provision an environment, you have to choose what kind of environment you want to have with elastic beanstalk. And you have two options, you have a web environment or a worker environment. And so the key difference is that a web environment is for running a web application and a worker environment is for running background jobs, or long running jobs that you would normally use with a web application in another environment. So it's very common, if you need your full workload to deploy a web environment and a work worker environment. Let's talk about some of the components that vary between the two. So in a web environment, it is deploying an auto scaling group. And generally it will deploy a load balancer. We'll talk about the variance here because I have an asterisk there because there is some variations for web environments. On the work environment, it will create an auto scaling group, it'll also create an SQS queue, it'll install the SQS daemon on the EC two instances, and it will create cloud watch alarms to dynamically scale instances based on their health. But we'll talk about the two variants of the web environment in the next video. Okay.
