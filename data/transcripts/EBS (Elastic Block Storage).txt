 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. Let's take a look at EBS. But before we do, let's define some terms up front. So we know what they are. The first is I ops op stands for input output per second, it is the speed at which non continuous reads and writes can be performed on the storage medium. Hi, I o equals lots of small, fast reads and writes, what is throughput, the data transfer rate to and from the storage medium in the megabytes per second, unless it's megabits. But we'll also what is bandwidth, this is the measurement of total possible speed of data movement along the network. Think of bandwidth equaling pipes and throughput equaling water. So let's talk about EBS. EBS elastic block store is a highly available and durable solution for attaching persistent persistent block storage volumes to an easy to instance. Volumes are automatically replicated within their AZ to protect from component failure, the types of volumes you can deploy, we have general purpose, we have general purpose, version three, we have provisioned IO. So IO one, we have provisioned IO two, we have IO block Express, we have cold hard drives, we have throughput optimized hard drives, we have magnetic. So there's a lot of stuff going on here. And I mean, this is a general summary, the idea is that usually when you have a newer version, it's going to be cheaper or faster. And that was the case for GP three, IO two does not exist anymore. Basically, you should always use IO two, and we'll talk about that right now. So all IO two volumes created after November 21 2023, our IO two block volumes, or two volumes created before 2023 can be converted over to an IO two block Express volumes, we're going to go over in detail all these types of volumes, you have to know them all. Not so much IO two, but IO two block Express. So we'll compare that next here. Okay.
