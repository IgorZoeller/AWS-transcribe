 Let's take a look at Amazon Linux, which is AWS's managed Linux distribution that is based off of CentOS and Fedora, which in turn is based off of Red Hat Linux. So let's get into it. There are multiple versions of Amazon Linux, we have Amazon Linux one, Amazon Linux two, and the current version of this time this video Amazon Linux 2023. So I would just say that if you're going to use one, you should be using 2023. As there's not many reasons to use the older ones, unless there's, you're just having a hard time getting your software to run on the latest and greatest and you need something that is more with what your app works with. But anyway, it was hardens and maintains the Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux often has direct support or the only choice for specific service is as the choice as the underlying OS. AWS provides technical support via the end of the support. So when you open up case cases, to get help from technical support, they're going to have a better understanding of the Amazon Linux. And if you bring them something that they aren't usually looking at, they just might not help you as well. So when you can use Amazon Linux, because it's pretty easy to use. It uses the Yum package manager, which technically there is an improved version of Yum called DNF that's available on Amazon 20 Linux 2023. But if you're using one or two, you're going to be using the package manager on June 30 2024. CentOS Linux seven will reach its end of life. Amazon Linux two is strongly tied to CentOS. So migrate to Amazon Linux 2023 when you can, because a lot of the the packages and stuff are is tied to that. So you know, I'm sure we'll see use after that for Amazon Linux two because Amazon Linux is one is still be utilized, even though I don't really recommend it for use. But yeah, there is a thing called Amazon Linux extras, which is specific for Amazon Linux two. And this is a way for you to install additional software packages that are not included with Amazon Linux two. And this is really useful because, you know, prior to Amazon Linux two, there was a l one, I remember Amazon Linux, because it had tons and tons of packages. But then when they moved to Amazon Linux, to all those packages weren't there, which is a good thing, because less packages generally means a more hardened server, because there's less things around for a malicious actor to utilize. But for whatever reason, when they moved to AL 2023, I think it's because they're using a different upstream from CentOS, whatever the version is eight or nine, they just had more available packages and less of an issue. But I don't think people liked Amazon Linux extras are having to install stuff to get stuff. And so basically, AL 2023 kind of works like al one word just has a lot of packages. So this is not going to work for Amazon 2023. It's for specifically for Amazon Linux two. Still talking about Amazon Linux two, there is a thing called extra package for enterprise Linux called EP EL. And it's a fedora project. And the idea was to add additional packages. And basically, this is what Amazon Linux extras is, but this is more generic and taps into even more packages. So if there's something that Amazon Linux extras cannot do, you can install EP EP EL via Amazon Linux extras, and then you'll have access to a larger variety of packages. So while Amazon Linux extras can be used to install packages, if you need a broader range of packages, you can use the EPA l seven repo or library, whatever you want to call it. So Amazon is to has high compatibility with cent OS seven, it can support EP EL seven packages, I've seen even eight being used. But you can't install three Amazon Linux extras, and I probably wouldn't recommend it. I think it's worth comparing al two to al 2023. Because this is going to be the toss up no one's touching al one these days here. But al two, it has limited packages but can be extended with Amazon extra and our P l seven Amazon is 2023 contains 1000s of packages for use, you cannot use RP EL with Amazon is 2023. I didn't write that in here, but I'm just telling you can't. So if you don't have a package you want to use, you're going to be having to solve from source to be honest, al two comes packaged with 2.7, where the default for Amazon is 2023 is Python three, l two uses yum, where al 2023 uses DNF. Could you install DNF on l two, probably l two, has SC Linux, so security enhanced Linux disabled by default, where l 2023 has it enabled by default, l 20, al twos using the older version of open SSL, where l 2023 is using the latest l two uses the cent OS seven stream where l 2023 uses the cent OS nine stream, l two is going to use the GP two volumes by default, whereas l 2023 is going to use the GP three volumes by default, l two has crony install, which gives you the cron tab behavior by default, if you want cron tab behavior, you're gonna have to install crony yourself, l two has open JDK because at the time, I don't think Amazon Corretto existed. Now Amazon Corretto exists. If you don't know what that is, it's a data buses, Java runtime library. So you know, it's whatever reason they made their own, everyone seems to want to make their own runtime runtime for Java and it was has made their own as well. But there you go.
