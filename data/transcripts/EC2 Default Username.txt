 The default username of an OS managed by AWS will vary based on its OS distribution. Why do we care about the default username? Well, often you'll have to use sessions manager to get into your instance. And if you were to check what user you are, you're always the SSM user, but you have to switch out to the default user, that's where you're supposed to do stuff. And so you need to know what that is. If you want to use SSH, you absolutely need to know what the default user is. So let's take a look at what it is. And I'm going to tell you, if you just remember EC2 user, it's gonna make your life easy in most cases. But for all the Amazon Linux distributions, one, two and 23, they're all easy to user for the OS, the CentOS OS, ami, which is managed by the bus, it's going to be easy to user other ones might be CentOS, if you're using Debian, it's going to be admin, if you're using Fedora, it's easy to user if you're using Red Hat Linux, it could be easy to user or root, I feel like if it's managed by AWS, it's always going to be easy to user. And if it's marketplace, probably the normal default, which is the admin or root, or or the name of the distribution. For sushi, we have easy to user or root for Ubuntu, we have Ubuntu for Oracle, we have EC two user for bitnami. And those aren't necessarily management, but but Nami always uses bitnami. So you know, you've been like the ones I remember is always a user, if you're using Ubuntu is Ubuntu if you're using bitnami, it's the dummy and that's that's as simple as it gets. Okay, but otherwise check with the am provider because there can be variation.
