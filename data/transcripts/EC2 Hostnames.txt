 A hostname is a unique name in your network to identify a machine via DNS, I want to point out that host names is not a concept specific to EC two, it's just a general thing that you should know. But we are going to talk about in the context of AWS. So the hostname format will vary based on what compute is being used, or specifically what region it's being used. We'll talk about the EC two hostname format here in a moment. But if you want to ensure your, if you want to change, change your your hostname, you need to ensure that you you preserve the hostname changes, and then you can go ahead and change it to something else because you could have your own domain, but you'd rather utilize to identify a specific instances for whatever reason. But you can do that on AWS, and you can reboot it can do that basically with any virtual machine. But I just wanted to make that very clear. Changing the hostname could be necessary in specific use cases where software is expecting a very specific name. So I found that when I was working with Kubernetes, and I was setting up service meshes, this is where I had to start fiddling with host names. But for the most part, you probably don't have to touch it, especially if you're a developer, on the networking side, they know they know what's best. And they might fiddle with these things a lot more. There are two hostname types for the guest OS hostname for EC two in particular, or we should say AWS. And it's going to be dependent on whether you're in us east one or other regions why it's different in this matter, I have no idea why but it is. And the first is IP name. So this is the legacy naming scheme scheme. Based on the private IP address, it says legacy. But I don't think it's that bad to use. And most people are using IPv4. So if you launch an instance with only IPv4, it's going to be using this format. So if you're in us, he's one, you'll notice that it will have the IP address going to the pen out here. So it has the private IP address, then dot EC two and internal, okay. Other regions for some weird reason, the region is now included, which is not that weird. But the fact that the changes were to compute, why I have no idea. The other one is resource name. So this is the other type of hostname format. And this is if you're going to be using IPv6. And you can use dual stack if sorry, if you if you choose to have an instance that has both IPv4, IPv6, then you can choose between which one you want IP name and resource names. But if you only have IPv6, you're going to be using resource names. If you only have IPv4, you're going to be using IP names. And so here, it's using the instance ID as the identifier, and it's following the same format where it has here, you can see the region. And then here it says compute. So there you go.
