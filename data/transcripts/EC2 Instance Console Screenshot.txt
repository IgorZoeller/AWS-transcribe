 instance console screenshot will take a screenshot of the current state of your instance very straightforward. Why would you want this? This is useful if you're trying to troubleshoot booting issues when you cannot access the instance via SSH and RDP. This is not the same thing as the system log is that showing you log information where this is literally showing you what it'd be like if you were to SSH in or trying to gain access. And so sometimes what you see here is not a login screen and something else that's more useful, or the information at the top could be useful. This works for both Linux and Windows. So you might see what the window screen looks like. You can use the CLI to grab the screenshot if you prefer. And again, this is if something went wrong, you might see something other than a login screen. But there you go.
