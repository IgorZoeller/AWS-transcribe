 What are instance families? Well, they are different combinations of CPU, memory storage and networking capacity. And the idea is you allows you to choose the appropriate combination of capacity to meet your applications unique requirements. So different instance families are different because of the varying hardware used to give them their unique properties. So I don't think this is the whole list, but it's most of the families that I want you to know. And then we'll look at the full list after this in a different perspective. The first is general purpose. So here we have a bunch, we have a one, the T line, the M line, I want to point out that a one is actually a previous generation one, but I put it in there anyway, they used to run arm. But you know, there can be families that are previous generation or, or that you wouldn't necessarily want to select, but they're around for legacy reasons. And so that's an example of a previous generation instance type. So the idea of the general purpose balance of compute memory networking resources, but even between the T's and the M's, there is a key difference, which we'll talk about the next slide. These case here is web servers and code repos, then you have compute optimized, that was going to be your seed line. And these are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors. This could be for scientific modeling, dedicated gaming servers, or add server engines, or even a cheaper form of machine learning training, or inference when you can't afford the GPUs, we have memory optimized. So that's going to be our R line or x line. And the Z line. This is a fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory. This is for in memory caches in memory databases, real time big data analytics, we have the accelerated optimize. So this is your P line, your G line, your INF, that's for inference one and VT. This is for hardware accelerators or co processors. So this is for machine learning compute finance, seismic analysis, speech recognition. So imagine you have GPUs attached to it, I think. So we have storage optimize. So you have your I line your D line, and h1, this is high sequential read and write access to a very large data set on local storage. So the example here could be no SQL in memory transactional databases, data warehousing, I wouldn't get so fixated on the numbers or the family versions, as some of these are could be a bit dated now. But what's important to remember is the individual letters as they are going to really help you indicate this stuff. Common instances, families, families are called instance types. But an instance type is a combination of size and family. So just understand that that term gets mixed up. And here's the other view. So this is actually the full list as of today. So you can see we have compute dense FPGA, graphics intensive, high performance computing, storage optimize, storage optimize with a different ratio for VPC memory for one to four, one to six. In for net, yeah, I don't even know how to say but it's for inference for machine learning. That's a special chip that AWS has produced general purpose Mac, which you can run Mac OS, which is pretty cool GPU accelerated memory optimized burstable performance. Training train tanium, which is for training machine learning, because it has special hardware for that hyper high memory, video encoding memory intensive, but there are two that I really want to point out. And this is from the general purpose families, we have the T line, which offers or so we did the M first, but the M offers an even balance of compute memory and networking. And then the T family is the cheapest family that you're going to be familiar with, because it's in the free tier. And it's great for variable workloads. Basically, the burstable ones allow you to burst for a period of time beyond your usual compute. But if you want more stable memory, or sorry, stable capacity of what you're utilizing, then the end line is going to be great. But you're going to use it at a certain point, when you're apt to come stable, and you need a certain level of usage because they're just not as cheap as the T line. So there you go.
