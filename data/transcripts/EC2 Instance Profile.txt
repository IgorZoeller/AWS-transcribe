 EC two instance profile is a reference to an IAM role that will be passed and assumed by the EC two instance when it starts up. So the idea is that the instance profile is really a reference to IAM role. And that instance profile is associated with the EC two instance, the whole purpose is to avoid passing long live credentials. So you don't have to hard code, or somehow pass your access key and secret into your into your OS environment. And the way it's really doing this is using STS assumed. So if you don't understand that, we cover that in the CLI section. But anyway, EC two instance profile can be associated at the time of launch or on a running EC two instance. So if you forget to do this, you can do it after the fact. However, if you never had an EC two instance profile attached a hard boot reboot reboot is required for the role to be assumed because otherwise it will just not work and you will waste a lot of time. This is something we'll definitely demonstrate in a lab because it should be known only a single IAM role can be associated with an instance profile. Changing roles is not instantaneous due to eventual consistency, which is why we need a hard reboot in the first case. But if you need the role immediately, you need to disassociate and re associate the profile or do a hardroot reboot of the instance. When you select the IAM role when launching an EC two instance, AWS will automatically create an instance profile for you. So you don't really notice this in the console. But when you definitely use the AWS CLI, you are creating an instance profile. And you can't see instance profiles anywhere in the management console. The only way you can see a list of them is via the API, which is why we're looking at the CLI commands here. So we have creating the instance profile, adding a single IAM role to instance profile because you can only have a single role attached to instance profile, associate instance profile to the EC two instance, I'm not sure why I didn't put the word EC two on the end there. But say to the EC two, EC two, there we go. You can list the I am I am up, I say I'm roles, but I am profiles, really mucking up here today. And then you can get information about a specific instance profile again, role, but we're saying instance profile here, but there you go.
