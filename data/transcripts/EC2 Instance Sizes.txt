 Let us talk about instance sizes. So each instance type includes one or more instance sizes that you can choose from, that allows you to scale your resources based on your target, target workloads capacity requirements. So easy to instance size, generally, double in price and key attributes. This is not always the case. But for the most part, if you're going to go to the next size, like from a small to a medium or whatever, you should see double the VPC use and RAM. But there is more to the story as the other things like network throughput is not necessarily going to be double. And these jumps are not always double but anyway, when we see small, medium, large, extra large, just make a note of the numbers. So 112 to 24 to 36. So not exactly double here, this is the same and this is increased but now over here to 54. So you know, the most part, it doubles the kind of holds true. And in terms of cost, and again, this is just the T two line, but you can see $16 roughly double here, roughly double here, roughly double here. So you know, understand that, you know, things are generally doubling as they go up, okay.
