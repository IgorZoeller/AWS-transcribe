 Placements groups lets you choose the logical placement of your instance to optimize for communication performance, durability. And another nice thing to know is placement groups are free. I've never had to fill with this. But I'm sure some folks who have more impressive workloads have had to do that. Let's talk about the three different types of placement groups. The first being cluster. This packs instances close, close together inside an availability zone. It's low latency network performance for tightly coupled node to node communication. It's well suited for HPC apps, and clusters cannot be multi AZ. You have partition to spreads instances across logical partitions. Each partition does not share the underlying hardware with each other. So it's rack per partition. It's well suited for a large distributed replicated workloads such as Hadoop, because Cassandra and Kafka, then we have spread this is each instance is placed on a different rack. When critical instances should be kept separate from each other. You can spread a maximum of seven instances and spread can be a multi AZ. So there you go.
