 The EC two source and destination check when enabled restricts an instance to only send and receive traffic where it is the source or the destination. And why would you want to disable this feature or even have it? Well, the idea is that there could be use cases where let's say you want to create your own net, which we do in this course, you would need it to pass along someone else's address, because it would have to do network address translation. And so this is a case where you'd want to turn off source and destination checks. Source and destination checks are great to have on because they protect against malicious behavior or you know, using your machine to do nefarious things. But again, there are legitimate cases for turning off source and destination checks. There you go.
