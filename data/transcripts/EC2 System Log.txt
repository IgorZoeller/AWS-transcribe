 In the EC2 Management Console, it allows you to observe the system logs for the EC2 instance. This is really great when you are trying to troubleshoot your instance, because you see something like it's not working as expected. But let's say you don't necessarily want SSH into it, or you simply can't, you know, there might be some information here, when it runs clouded, and you can even see it in there, it's actually showing some things that clouded init is doing. Some marketplace and community amis will write the default username and password for software in the system log for you to initially log into whatever web technology is there, and then you'd obviously change it after the fact. So you know, you can come across some log for a few reasons. logs can be delivered to cloud watch logs by installing the cloud watch unified agent and can be accessed through a cloud watch log group of the same name of the instance. So this is something that you have to install. I always think that it's pre installed, but it's not necessarily installed. But there is a way to use systems manager to easily install it on systems like Amazon Linux 2023. If you do get it installed, then you will be able to see all these logs collected and put into cloud watch log, which is extremely useful. If you're using Amazon Linux 2023, you might not have the same amount of logs and the log structures might be a bit different. I highlight those ones in red because often I find that sometimes when I'm troubleshooting stuff, I actually have to go look at cloud init to see how it was executing that stuff there. But yeah, there you go.
