 So you can provide a script to your EC two user data to have cloud in it automatically run on first boot. So the idea is that you have an EC two instance, you want to have some stuff installed the first time it launches up. And so this is where you can inject your script. So there is a box that you can provide or you can provide a programmatically we're going to focus on the programmatic way because I think that's more value to you. But that script is going to either look like a bash script. And this example installs an Apache web server, which is my go to for showcasing user data. And we use it a lot in the course, or you can use a cloud config yaml file. So this is a yaml file for a very specialized syntax that is defined by cloud in it. So if you want to know more about that, you can look it up, you'll notice that it's a little bit more modular and more flexible. So if you have something that's a bit larger, you might find that very useful. Of course, you could use ansible in place of user data. But this user data script is great for smaller amounts of things. But yeah, anyway, these scripts that you utilize, they must be basic for when directly using the API. But we're always going to be using the CLI in the console. So we don't have to worry about converting these scripts into base 64. And coding, I think somewhere in this course, we talked about base 64. But the idea is that it is transforming it into something that is not necessarily human readable, but is more compressed when passing it along to these programs. So I just want to show you that in the end of CLI, we could pass a file. And so here, I'm specifying a bash script, or you can use it in line. So apparently, there is this multi line option, I don't even think I've tested that. But chat GPT told me that you could do multi line, which I was surprised I'm used to doing as a single line. But anyway, those are two options. And we'll definitely test test these things out for real. One other thing I want to point out is that if you ever wonder what your user data script is, you can use EC two metadata using w get or curl, and hit the endpoint to find out exactly what you're using. But usually you don't have to do that. But that is a method that you could use. Okay.
