 Let us take a look here at EC two, which stands for elastic compute cloud. And it is a highly configurable virtual server that allows you to resize it to meet your compute capacity. And it takes minutes to launch new instances. And I like to call it the backbone of AWS, because basically, every kind of compute pretty much runs on EC two, whether you can directly see the EC two instances or not, the everything is going to be running basically on some kind of machine, and usually it is going to be EC two. So you know, the procedure in terms of what you're going to do when you go ahead and launch an EC two instance, you're going to first choose your OS via an Amazon machine image. And this could be a variety of different operating system distributions, which AWS has access to quite a few, if not the most out of all cloud service providers, then you'll choose your instance type, which is going to determine the actual resources that you'll have underneath. So that would determine, you know, the type of hardware that you're going to be using, and also the amount of v CPUs, memory, network throughput, and things like that, then you'll want to add your storage such as EBS, or EFS. There's a variety of different types of storage mediums that you can attach to your EC two instances. And then there's a lot of things that we can configure. So security groups for our firewalls key pairs to SSH into user data to run a script on startup, I am role so that we can or instance profiles so that we can provide the CC two instance access to other it has resources, placement groups and more. But that really scratches the surface as about easy to but we will dive deeply into it here, starting now.
