 Hey, this is Andrew Brown and we are taking a look at EFS. So EFS is a file storage service for easy to instances. It has the storage capacity that grows up to petabytes and shrinks automatically based on the data stored. So it's considered elastic. Multiple easy to instances in the same VPC can mount a single EFS which is super powerful. Volumes must be in the same VPC, etc. instances install, install the NFS version 4.1 client and can mount the EFS volume EFS is using the network file system version four protocol, if it creates multiple mount targets, and all your VPC subnets. Your spend is based on space use starting at 30 cents gigabytes per month, it's going to obviously vary based on where you live. And so here is a good screenshot of those mount targets. I'm using an older screenshot because I don't like the newer representation and the new UI. So I'm just showing you this but the idea is that you have multiple mount targets. I did not tell you this or write it in the slides here but you can mount EFS to other services such as lambda such as Fargate. So it is a useful service and not just for easy to but most compute services for AWS. So that is something that is super useful. So there you go.
