 The Amazon EFS utils package is an open source collection of Amazon EFS tools also known as the EFS client. You can find it here at AWS EFS utils on github.com. The EFS client enables the ability to use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor an EFS file system mount status, you need to install Amazon EFS client on the EC two instance prior to mounting the EFS file system. It includes the Amazon EFS mount helper, which makes it easier to mount EFS file systems. Mount helper is a program that you use when you when is used when you mount a specific type of file system. And so there was a whole different way of doing this before. And so now this is a much easier way to mount. This is the way you'd install Amazon Linux to the docs seem to be really focused on Amazon Linux to not so much on 2023. So when we do the lab, we'll obviously use the latest and see what we run into EFS mount helper provides the following options. It has mounting on supported EC two instances, mounting with I am authorization mounting with Amazon EFS access points, mounting with on premise Linux client auto mounting EFS file systems. When an EC two instance reboots mounting a file system when creating an EC two instance can mount either Linux or Mac. So it's super robust. There's no reason not to use the EFS mount helper part of EFS client. Amazon EFS does not support mounting from Amazon EC two window in this instances. Before EFS mount helper standard Linux NFS client was recommended for mounting that's how you had to do it. Mount helper defines a new network file system type called EFS, which is fully compatible with the standard mount mount command in Linux. Mount helper also supports automating mounting as an EFS at the instance boot via etc. at the staff configuration. net dev option is used to identify that NFS when mounting your file system automatically if emitted EC two might stop responding. So that is a configuration you might care about. Here's how you would mount it. So I'm just gonna get my pen tool so we can get a little bit closer here to see what we're doing. So here we're saying EFS, we're using TLS. And then we're providing either the file system DNS name here, the file system ID, which I believe is this, and the mount target IP address, which is this, there's a variant of this in the docs, but this is pretty much it. And this actually is for mounting multiple IP addresses. So there's one where anyway, this is the one that you should use. The FS management console will provide the code via the attach button. So you don't have to figure this stuff out, they make it pretty easy for you. EFS mount helper will will use the following mount option. So we have version 4.1 use when mounting recently to Linux 4.0 when you are mounting to supported Mac instances, the R size is whatever that number is, that's the maximum number of bytes. Okay, we have the W size, we have hard to set the recovery behavior at FS client after an NFS request times out. So the NFS requests are retried indefinitely. We have the timeouts at the timeout value of NFS client used to wait for response before it retries. This is set to 60 seconds. It has two numbers of times it will retry a request before it attempts to recover. We have no res port. So it tells NFS client to use a non privileged TCP source port when a network connection is reestablished. We have mount port at 204 2049 for Mac instances. I didn't mean to go the next slide, but there you go. Okay, ciao.
