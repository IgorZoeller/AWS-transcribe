 So elastic IPs and AWS are addresses that are just simply static IP for addresses. That means that you'll always have the same address no matter what. And so the idea is that we have a few different use cases. The first use case will be when you restart an EC two instance, and its IP address will change. This happens every time you restart it, you might end up with a new IP address. Or if let's say you have a workload, and you stop it, or so you terminate, you spin up a new one, it will absolutely have a new IP address, this could be an issue, if you have something that relies on the on the hard coded IP address, it will break. So you know, most systems try to stay away from relying on static IP addresses. But when you're integrating with things externally, for me to us, or you're working with legacy systems, sometimes there's no way around it, okay. For use case number two, when an EC two instance fails, you might want to use the same IP address. And the case of a failover instance, so you have more than one instance, and you just want that IP address to carry over. So the elastic IP address allows you to do that because you can remap it to another instance or a network interface card. Elastic IPs are region specific, so you can't use them across regions. Elastic IPs are drawn from the Amazon pool of IP to four addresses as long as they have one, you can get one elastic IPs are charged $1 for each that is allocated and unassociated because they want you to use them not to just allocate them and never use them. So they incentivize that incentivize you returning them back to the pool when unused by providing by charging for it. Elastic IPs are subject to the new ipv4 charge, which is for any public IP address that you're using. This is the whole thing about there's a limited amount of IP addresses, so they're kind of at a premium. And you should try to use ibv6 where you can, assuming that they work as expected. Elastic IPs can be associated or unassociated to an EC EC two instance, or an ENI elastic network interface card, which really in theory, they're about just going to the ENI because EC two instance has a network attached card to it. And they're always going and pointing to that. But understand that you can point it to either the NIC, or the EC two instance. If you notice, I keep using different words, it's because an ENI is a NIC, and it is a network attached card. So there's a lot of ways that we can say that the same thing 10 times over. So I try to utilize more language there. So you're in better shape to understand that. You might be wondering, well, this is for ipv4. What do we do for ipv6? Well, ipv6 doesn't really require elastic IP because addresses are already globally unique. Is there static IP addresses for ipv6? I guess so. But anyway, my research pointed that we don't need them for ipv6. And so this is really more about ipv4. So elastic IP does not support ipv6. For obvious reasons, let's go take a look at some CLI commands. So we can just better understand the workflow when working with these elastic IPs. The first is allocating your your IP, there is one option there where you can specify the network board group where you can, you can pick very specific az local zones or wavelength zones, I didn't even know that. So this is something that doesn't show up in the UI. But you can really narrow down exactly what kind of network you're trying to target. So I guess it works outside of just your plain old VPCs, we have, we have to associate our elastic IP address, so we need to associate the elastic IP to an instance, you could also use the network interface ID to associate to a network interface. And now thinking about it, I'm not even sure if the UI allows you to directly associate to a network interface card. So maybe the only way to do it is through the CLI command, I'm not sure. We can disassociate our EIPs, that's pretty straightforward. And then we can deallocate or release our, our IP back to the pool, there's a little bit more. So this is where we get kind of into like more interesting things that you can do with elastic IPs. But I never ever do them because they're more exotic. But you could have a reassociation. So you can tell an address to always attempt to re associate with the same instance or network interface in the case of a failure restart. So that is an example of having that failover example. You can tell it to explicitly not to re associate, which I'm not sure why that's an option. But anyway, that is an explicit option you can have because I think by default, it already says not to do it. So there's that you can recover. So I didn't know this, I only found it out today with CLI. But you can attempt to if available, recover a specific address during allocation. So if you had like your favorite address that you use before, you could try to get it back or maybe you someone on your team accidentally put it back in the pool. And you want to get it back because things are hard coded. So as long as no one else has taken it, you can probably get it back. If you're lucky. You can also bring your own ipv4 address. I this is something I really didn't know until again, going through the CLI, but you can allocate one from a pool. So there is some way to import a public ipv4 pool ipv4 pool into as a separate step. So that's really interesting. But yeah, so there you go. That's elastic IP.
