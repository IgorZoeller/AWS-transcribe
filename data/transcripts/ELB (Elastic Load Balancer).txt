 and we are taking a look at elastic load balancer. But let's first talk about what is a load balancer. So it is a physical hardware or virtual software that accepts incoming traffic and then distributes the traffic to multiple targets. They can balance the load via different rules. These rules vary based on the types of load balancers. So ELB is a suite of load balancers used to balance or distribute traffic to multiple EC twos, ECS is Fargate EKS instances. I don't have the text here, but generally they are bound to a specific VPC. So it's not like these are regional load balancers. But we have the application load balancer, also known as ALB. And you really want to remember these initialisms because they're used a lot. And people just say ALB, NLB, stuff like that. Okay. But anyway, ALB, it operates on the OSI layer seven application layer. So this is HTTP, capable of routing based on HTTP information can leverage WAF for additional security, we have NLB. So this operates on the OSI layer three and four. So that's TCP UDP, designed for large throughput of low level traffic. Then we have the gateway load balancer. This is a newer one, also known as GWLB routes traffic to virtual appliances before traffic reaches its destination, useful as a security layer for traffic in transit. And just to describe it a bit more, the idea is that you are sending it to virtual machines that are going to then send it to the final destination. So it's just a layer of stuff. We have the classic load balancer CLB operates on the OSI layer seven and three, four doesn't use target groups directly attached targets, previous generation of load balancer that is only used in legacy cases where clients have not moved, I wrote no moved, but this should say not moved. Sorry about that over to ALB or NLB. So there you go.
