 Let's take a look at at ELB integration. This is the idea of taking elastic load balancer and attaching it to your auto scaling group. Here's an example of us using the CLI command to attach one. Notice that it's asking for the target group arms because the way you will associate a modern load balancer AWS is not by associating the load balancer directly, but its target groups and it will infer from there. Back in the day, all we had was classic load balancer. So you would just associate that directly. But now it is always through the target group for ALB MLB and the Gateway load balancer are associated indirectly via target groups and attach ALB means that the ASG can use the load balancers health checks instead of EC two and so that is the main advantage there.
