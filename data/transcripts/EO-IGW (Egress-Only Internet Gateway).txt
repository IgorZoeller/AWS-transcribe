 Let us take a look here at egress only internet gateways. It's not official, but I'm going to assume that it's eo-igw. I think I might have seen it a couple times. But that's, that's I think, a good way to distinguish it. Also, this service does not have an icon, I created this one. But I think it best represents what's going on here, which is the idea that we don't want to allow public access, it's only private access. So things should not be able to, from the internet come in to the into things. So anyway, let's read the description here. So the eo-igw are specific specifically for ipv6, when you want to allow outbound traffic to the internet to prevent inbound traffic from the internet, I think my icon best represents that. So the idea is that you'd still have to add your route. So you want a route out to the internet for IGW. So that should be very clear. ipv6 addresses are all public, so they don't require network address translation. However, IGW would not restrict the inbound traffic. So the eo-igw will ensure your instances are private by dying by denying inbound traffic. And again, it's as simple as that.
