 pointing out, there are two caching options, we have memcache. This is generally preferred for caching HTML fragments. It's a very simple key value store, the trade off of being very simple is that it's very fast, that you have Reddit, which can perform many different kinds of operations on your data. It's very good when you have structured data, as when we talk about Reddit, you'll see that they have a lot of data structures, memcache is just strings keen value. And so the fight here is that which one's faster. And generally, it can be argued that memcache is faster, because Redis has less, or it has more going on in it. But I don't know, it's very competitive. And I think that maybe Redis is now the fastest. But anyway, the point is, is that we have these two options. And depending on what web framework you use, some are plug and play, some are easier to use. So it's really up to you. In terms of feature set, you can see there's a bit of difference. So I'll just get my pen out here to highlight the very key difference here. But you can see that memcache does not use advanced data structures does not have snapshots, replications, transactions, pub, sub lose scripting, geospatial support. Another thing I noticed, which I didn't make a slide about this, but when you have Redis, you can, for very specific versions, I'm not sure which but you can have encryption in transit encryption at rest. But I noticed for memcache, it didn't do that. So specifically for a last a cache, so I'm not sure if it's just because they're writing the older version of memcache, or those capabilities are not there. Redis appears to have better security, at least on AWS. So there you go.
