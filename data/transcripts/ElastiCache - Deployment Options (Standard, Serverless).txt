 deploy options, you have the standard mode, which they just call elastic cache. Whether why don't they call these capacity modes? I don't know. Why is the service mode not called on the band? I don't know. But there's other services that are similar. But for whatever reason, they call this one elastic cache serverless. Is it serverless? Um, I guess so. Because it scales to zero, but I'd rather just call it like fully managed or something, as a lot of things are not service anymore. But we got service and standard the use case for service on predictable workloads, standard, predictable workloads, management automatically scales for serverless. For standard, you're managing the cluster and nodes for billing, it's going to be based on data stored and EP, e CPU units for serverless, I have no idea how those calculations come into play. But apparently, that's the thing for the serverless one. And for standard, it's based on the number of nodes and then the type of nodes like picking easy to instance, you pick a size and it's very similar there. There. The standard one can be deployed to on premise via AWS outpost. So that is another thing that is worth
