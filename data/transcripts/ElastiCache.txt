 So ElastiCache is a fully managed in memory data store for either the open source data stores, memcache, or Redis. And so ElastiCache is intended to cache data or HTML fragments, specifically memcache is is known to do the latter to greatly improve response times in the 10s of hundreds of milliseconds. So when I say that, I mean like down to that time, not that it'll shave off 10 to 100 milliseconds, otherwise, that wouldn't be very useful. So there's kind of an architectural diagram of ElastiCache. But the key emphasis there is that it also cache is deployed within a VPC. And so your last cache cluster or data is only accessible when you have resources deployed in the same VPC. It was tells us the reason why for this limitation is so that ensures low latency because if it goes across regions, or or other places, it's not going to be as fast could you use VPC lattice or peering to bring that cache somewhere else probably but the point is is that same VPC for the same resources. ElastiCache can be deployed in multiple availability zones for high availability. ElastiCache can be deployed on premise via its outposts. ElastiCache can use RBAC for Redis 6.0. So you can manage user access via the management console. And I actually didn't notice this until I came back and looked at the console. But it was has another service called memory DB and it's big sales that it has a UI to manage RBAC. But it's interesting to see ElastiCache got this. So when they got serverless, ElastiCache server seems like it's competing with their own other service. ElastiCache can be replicated cross region via ElastiCache global data store. So that is just a feature additional feature to bring your data into other regions, you can reserve nodes to save money when using ElastiCache standard. ElastiCache can be automated to perform backups of data source. So the last three are all or actually last four things are all new. Alaska is always a very simple service. But now they have backups, they have global data stores, and they have reserved nodes and they have the serverless mode. So you have two different
