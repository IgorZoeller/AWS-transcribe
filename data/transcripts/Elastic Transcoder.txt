 Hey, this is Andrew Brown. And we are taking a look at Ibus elastic transcoder, which is a fully managed video transcoding service. I think it's transcoding and not encoding, I always forget. Well, you know what it is transcoding because it has the name transcoder. And yes, of course, it's a video transcoding service that converts video from one format to another for video on demand. So VOD, or streaming videos. Interestingly enough, I used to use the service when we first made exam Pro, we tried to use the service, it was really expensive. It's still as expensive. And it's other modern version media convert is still expensive. So most saying people, they're going to do it are just going to run compute with FFmpeg and do it themselves. But anyway, let's take a look at how this works. So first of all, you cannot use transcoder with AWS CloudFormation. Now there's much to utilize with it. But like you can't set up a pipeline with CloudFormation, you can use the AWS SDK or CLI to automate things you need to do. The idea here is you create a pipeline, you create a job, you choose a preset, you choose a source and destination bucket. And the presets is a huge list of this stuff here on the right hand side. This is both a mix of audio and video system presets. And I want to point out that there is a newer service called media convert. That's like the modern version of last transcoder. But this service still sticks around because legacy customers have yet to move over to media convert. And to be honest, elastic transcoder is really easy to use. Because we do a lab in both and media convert, while very powerful, it's just a bit of a headache to configure whereas elastic transcoder, if all you need is this, it is straightforward. So I kind of feel like it was failed with the, like they made it more robust, but it could have also made the most base use case easier for the newer service. So we do a lab of this, even though it is an older service, it technically is still on the exam. But in case it does get replaced with media convert, which is not on the exam, we'll cover both of them to cover our bases. Okay.
