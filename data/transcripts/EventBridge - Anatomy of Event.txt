 an event for Amazon event bridge and all the top level fields listed here will always appear in a single event. And the contents of the fields appearing under just the detail section will vary based on the cloud watch service that emits the event. And when you're looking at cloud trail, there's definitely a lot in there. Let's start at the top here. So the version by default, it's always going to be set to zero, I assume that this is just for namespacing, maybe it was in the future will make it one a, you have an ID. So that's a unique value generated from every event, you have the detail type, this identifies fields and values that appear in the detail field. The source this identifies the service that the source that's that source the event, you have the 12 digit number identifying the items account, you have the event timestamp, you have the region, you have the resource of this, this could be a JSON array containing ARNs that identify resources that are involved in the event. And then you have detail, this is a JSON object containing data provided by the cloud service and contain 50 fields nested several levels deep. Okay, so there you go.
