 So Amazon event bridge integrates directly with a lot of AWS services, but not with all of them, because not all services emit a cloud watch event. So for the ones that don't, what we can do is we can use cloud trail. So over here, this is cloud trail, all the data that you'd see. And so turning on cloud trail allows event bridge to track changes to the services made by API calls or by AWS users. At the top there, you can see we have a detail type cloud trail, we'll call it AWS API call via cloud trail, and AWS API calls events that are larger than 256 kilobytes in size are not supported. Okay. So yeah, it's just that's how you get integration with other services, you just use it through cloud trail events.
