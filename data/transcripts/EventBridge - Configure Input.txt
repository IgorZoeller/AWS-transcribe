 configure input. And again, this is what allows us to filter out data that our rules match before we pass it along. So match events is going to match everything. Part of a match event is going to only match part of the event text that you specify. So if you put in dollar sign dot detail, it's only going to match, it's only going to pass along detail. If you use constant, this is basically mocked data. So you can just provide any kind of JSON object, and that's what it's going to pass along. You have input transformer, this one's pretty interesting. This is where you can kind of transform the text either into a string or into a JSON object arranged differently. So for this one here, you can see that we have a JSON object, and then we print them out as variables down below. So it's a string. And here, even though it's a very simple mapping, we could we could rename these or however we want, okay to change that JSON object. So you map fields from event data's to variables, then you use those variables in a string or JSON object. And that's what you get passed along. There are some variable names you cannot use. So you can't use a bus event rules aren't it was event rules aren't or a bus events, events. Okay. So but but again, you know, you see dollar sign dot detail instance, you're mapping it to a variable called instance, right? So the one on the right hand side dollar sign is like selecting the base of the JSON object and going dot detail dot instance. Okay, so there you go.
