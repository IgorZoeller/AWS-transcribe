 So now let's look at event patterns for Amazon event bridge. So event patterns are used to filter what events should be used to pass along to a target. So you can filter events by providing the same fields and values found in the original events. So let's say we have an event here and this event, it's only here to react to an EC two instance of its terminated. So look at that, that that script there, see the details type says EC two instance state change notification. And then under the details is state terminated. Okay. So what we can do is we can create our own little JSON object. And we're going to map the same fields to see how it has source and we have source in the top there. And we have detail type, and we have a detail state terminate. So we're only pulling the ones that we actually want to filter out from the top there. And what we can do in event bridge is we can choose event pattern, and we can go custom pattern and just paste that in there. And that's going to filter out events based on that, okay. And there's actually a lot more we can do with event patterns, because there's a lot of operators that we have. So we can do prefix matching. So match on the prefix of a value in the event source, we can do anything but matching matches anything except what the what's provided in the rule, we have numeric matching. So match against numeric operators, we have IP address matching, so match against available, available for matching against the IP address available for both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses exists matching. So matching works on the presence of or absence of a field in the JSON, empty value matching for strings, you can use just to double quotation, double quotations there. And for other values, you can just use null and complex examples with multiple matching. So you can combine a variety of these things there to do more complex event pattern matching. So there you go.
