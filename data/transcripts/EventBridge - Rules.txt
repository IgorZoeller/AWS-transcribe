 So let's take a look at event bridge rules. So this is the whole thing that we want to achieve, right, you create rules that react to events in AWS. So you can specify up to five targets in a single rule. Very commonly used a with services would be lambda function, SQS, SNS, firehose, and ECS, you can see there's a very long list. So event bridge integrates with a lot of stuff, you may have some additional fields to select the target. So if you do choose a lambda function there, you might have some additional fields, you can fill in like lambda function, alias, and version, whatever target you choose, you're going to get different fields, you can specify what gets passed along by changing the configure input, this acts as sort of a filter, because when you have a rule, and it collects event, you might not want to pass all the event data along. And so we have a bunch of options here. So for match events, it's going to match the the entire event pattern just pass it along. So basically, this is just act as normal. But we're going to look at all the configure inputs here in detail next. So now let's take a look at
