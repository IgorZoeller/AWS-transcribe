 So now let's take a look at schedule expressions for Amazon event bridge. So you can create an event bridge rule that's triggered on a schedule. And you can think of it as a serverless cron job. So all scheduled events use UTC timezone, the minimum precision for schedules is one minute, and event bridge supports cron expressions and rate expression. So let's look at those two right now. So chronic cron expressions allow you to have very fine grained control. But they use that weird cron syntax. So you'd have to go look up cron tab cron job, or etc. And I'm not going to really explain it here because I don't think it's necessary for the exams. But I just want to show you that you have that kind of syntax there. And you can specify it to run at 1215 Monday to Friday or every 15 minutes, it's very, very robust. On the other side, you have rate expressions, these are easy to set set, but they're not as fine grained. As you can see, just pick a number and you have a drop down between hours, minutes and days. Okay, so there you go.
