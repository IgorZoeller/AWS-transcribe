 showing up here again for another course. And let's get to it. Ciao. Hey, this is Andrew Brown, and we are asking the most important questions first, which is what is the solution architect associate. So this is a concept based in a certification. I say that because it's mostly focused on conceptual knowledge as opposed to implementation. But this will cover the broadest amount of core of services, light knowledge on implementation, a larger focus on theoretical limits and functionality of AWS services, and a light focus on high level architecting cloud workloads and choosing the appropriate database service to meet the business use case. The course code for the solutions architect associate is the essay s 03. So make sure when you book your exam that the course code matches what we show here because this is what this course is optimized for. The solution architect associate is the most popular cloud certification among all cloud certifications. But it's also the most saturated certification. So consider accompanying the certification with other skills. And we'll talk about that when we look at the future slides in this video here. So who is the certification for will consider the SAA if you want to work as a cloud engineer, notice I didn't say solutions architect. We'll talk about that a bit more here in a moment. But generally a cloud engineer or cloud developer is what this kind of content is targeted for. If you enjoy the idea of understanding how to architect multiple services together into a cloud workload, then this is a great course for that, though they all kind of do that anyway, for all the associates, but this one has a larger focus on it. Or if you just don't know which associate to take, then you should just take this one because it's the general one and then you can figure out after afterwards what you'd really want to focus on. So let's take a look at our a bit certification roadmap. As of today, these are the certifications that are available. And these are the lines that I have drawn as possible paths you can take and possible cloud related roles that you might want to target. But I do want to point out that it have certifications do not validate programming, technical diagramming, code management, and many other technical skills that are required for obtaining technical roles. I have seen people get like seven certifications all the way to pros and specialties. And then when we went to evaluate their skills, we found out they did not know how to clone a get repo. They did not know how to write a lick of code. So it is possible to pass these by just studying the lecture content. But I'm going to tell you that if you want to be job ready, you need to do some extra work. One other thing that I would like to just suggest as a way of optimizing your study pattern. Even if you don't plan on taking the other associates like the SysOps administrator, the developer or the data engineer, you can study the SysOps administrator, the solution architect associate and the developer associate at the same time because they have a lot of overlap. And I personally recommend doing that because you'll just save yourself a considerable time and get the right amount of knowledge you're going to need to be something like a cloud engineer, or any of those entry level, or early or like junior level rules in cloud rules. Okay, so how long does it take to study this certification? Well, if you're beginner, you're looking about at 60 hours. So let's assume that you have the cloud practitioner, you've never written code or held a tech role. So yeah, you're looking at that if you are experienced. So you have practical experience working with AWS, and you have the equivalent experience of other certifications, or CSPs, then you are probably going to be looking at 20 hours, this certification has grown in time. So it used to be half the time like three years ago, but AWS has just added so many more services, and they've increased the difficulties of the exam. There's more expected of you. So understand that the study time is just much longer, I would say average study time probably would be 24 hours, split your time between lectures and labs and practice exam. So as much time as you put into the lecture lab content, you should probably put into practice exams, I recommend one or two hours a day for 24 days, try to contain all your study time within a month, I find that people that take two months or three months, they feel like they've gone through all the content, but in reality, they've forgotten the stuff at the start of their journey. And then they have to extra study to remember the information that they forgot. So understand that there. So what does it take to pass exam? Well, watch the video lectures and memorize key information, do the hands on labs and followings with your own account. And I highlight followings or the labs in red, because you really, really should do them. And my approach is that I like to do a lot of labs and try to make them as real world as possible. So you will find that that is what you'll see a lot in my courses. And there'll be less of these beautiful looking diagrams, but they don't necessarily teach you the practical skills. So understand that I would strongly recommend getting some paid online practice exams that simulate the real exam. And if you just don't have the money, but you need a practice exam, we do have a full free practice exam on the exam Pro platform, which you can find at exam pro.co forward slash SAA, hyphen C 03. So make sure you get access to that. So you do better on your exam. Let's talk about the content outline. And we will open up the exam guide PDF, and we'll take a closer look at that after this video. The exam of questions is broken into four domains. Each domain has its own weighting and this determines how many questions in a domain that will show up. So the first domain is design secure architecture. Domain two is design resilient architecture. Domain three is design high performing architecture, and domain four is cost optimized architectures. Now, I recently sat the exam just to make sure that I my content matched the the exam guide in this domain breakdown. And I was really surprised to see that it did not. So I think what's happening here is that over time, because this certification is not new, I mean, it's like 2014 or older. But since the last refresh, it's just AWS has added so much content, so many services, so much stuff. And I would just say this service or this certification in particular is very bloated. And they've shoved everything into that exam guide. And the reality is that the exam guide breakdown of skills does not actually act accurately reflect the required knowledge of the exam. So I'll give you a really clear example is the first domain, the first domain says 30%. Because the design secure architectures, and I'm going to tell you, the exam wasn't that heavy on security. And there is a security specialty exam. So I think what we're looking at here is marketing. And it's unfortunate, but I just think that it's the nature of these being around for so long. So I'm hoping that AWS will fix it or adjusted at some point. But we'll have to see what happens there. So just understand that even though it says 30%, design secure architecture, it's not as security focused as it says it is. So where would you take this example, you can take it at an in person test center. And if you have that option, I strongly recommend it as then you're eliminating a lot of factors in your environment that will stress you out, you can do it online, which I have to do because I no longer live near a test center. But it can be stressful. But you have to choose what is going to work for you. It is delivers exams via Pearson Vue, and the Pearson Vue network of test centers. So they used to have psi psi online, but they've stopped offering that. So it's weird, because it used to be psi only, then they added Pearson, and then they got rid of psi online, and the psi network and Pearson is a much better experience than psi. So you're very lucky there. These exams are proctored. So I put it in double quotations, because I almost wonder if they're using assisted AI to do it these days. But the idea is that there is someone supervising, or a person who's monitoring students during an examination to prevent cheating. So just be prepared that you might have to interact with somebody, and you'll have to show your workspace and things like that. Let's talk about grading. So to pass exam, you need to get 720 points out of 1000. And I have an asterisk there because it uses scaled scoring. So the idea is that it's around that amount. So we always say around 72%, because you could literally get 72% and fail because of various factors.
