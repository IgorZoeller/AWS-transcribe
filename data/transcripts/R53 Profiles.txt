 Rev V3 profiles lets you apply and manage DNS related Rev V3 configurations across many VPCs in different AWS accounts. So resources you can associate with the profile are private hosted zones, Rev V3 resolver rules, DNS firewall rule groups, which I would believe that would be specific for roughly three resolvers DNS firewall. So the idea is you create a profile, detach those resources, pretty straightforward. But yeah, it's just a way of sharing configurations across many VPCs and AWS accounts. Okay.
