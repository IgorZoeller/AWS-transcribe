 Amazon revenue three resolver is a DNS server that allows you to resolve the queries between your on premise network and your VPC. So revenue three resolver was originally known as point two resolver, or Amazon DNS server. I don't remember the reason why it was called point two, there is a story behind that, which is now forgotten, probably one of my older videos, what I used to remember. But if you want to have a DNS server that's going to work with your VPC, then this is what you're going to utilize. So just look at the diagram here. There's two things that you can possibly configure, which are inbound and outbound endpoints. This really just depends on the direction of the traffic, you need things to go. So if you have an inbound resolver, this allows us queries to your VPC from your on premise network. And then outbound is DNS queries from your VPC to your on premise network knows that you create resolver rules. And these are going to work with private hosted zones, public domains, and VPC local domain names. I'm greatly simplifying the service. But because it is quite difficult to utilize if you don't have an on premise environment. But we do cover somewhere else, maybe not in the revenue three section. But we do cover about remedy three resolvers DNS firewall, which is one of the big advantages of using roughly three resolver but there you go.
