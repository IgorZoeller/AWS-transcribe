 We are taking a look here at record sets, which are collection of records, which determine where to send traffic, the way it works with the AWS API is you'll actually send it to batch changes. If you're using the AWS Management Console, it looks like you're individually creating adding deleting, but I want you to know that underneath does this kind of batch thing. If you've ever used any other kind of domain name, services or servers, you'll notice that they kind of have a batch approach to it. So that's why I like showing the API here. There are the following record types that are supported. So we have our alias record, the forays, which I believe is for IVV six, ca c name, ds, MX, naptor, ns, pointer, soa, SPF, s, RV, txt. And that's all of them there. If you don't know these are you should have done our domain name, server primer, where I talked about all the main ones here, I'm not going to talk about them here. But you should learn some of them as we work through this. I just want to point out here. What this is doing over here. So here we are calling the change record record sets, we're not creating or updating, it's just change. And then we provide our changes and we give it an action. And then here we are setting a C name and we're saying take this domain and pointed to that domain. So it's pretty simple. This API call has three types of actions, we have the create the delete and the upsert, create creates delete deletes upsert will create a record if it doesn't already exist. And if it already exists, it's going to update it.
