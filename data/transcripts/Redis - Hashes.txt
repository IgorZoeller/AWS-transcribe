 we have hashes. So hashes represent a mapping between string fields and string values. Redis was originally coded in Ruby, so they're basically Ruby hashes. But if you don't know Ruby hashes, there's JSON objects, probably seen those before Ruby hashes, of course, Python dictionary. So the idea is that you set a you say, Okay, I'm making a hash, I'm going to set a field, which is a key, it's string field to and its value there. So pretty straightforward.
