 lists. So lists are ordered collection of strings, they're not going to give you a guarantee of unique, unique strings or unique elements within that list there. So you can have duplicates. But you do things like l push l range, it's kind of like having an array in other languages here they're doing a range notice it does negative one, but it actually returns all of them. So that's kind of a trick there to get all the elements in a range, but you could say like one to two and then it would just return one and two common commands for lists would be l pop, our pop l push l. pos was just for positions l pop would remove the last element and return it on the left hand side. So the first one, our pop would be on the right hand side. So if you didn't help pop and return Hello, didn't our popular return world and also remove it from the list. l push would add a new thing on the end l pos is creating a position. So you provide a string, it'll tell you it's positioned in the list.
