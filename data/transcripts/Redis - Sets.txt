 then you have sets. So seems like they're like lists, but they're unordered. So there's no guarantee that if you request the stuff in the list, it's going to be in order that you expect it. But the advantage though, is that things are unique in the list. So if you push the same thing, you add the same thing to that set, like world twice, it'll only be there once. So that's when you need a unique amount of things in a collection there. Most common commands here is s add. So add a member s members show us all the members s move move a member from from one set to another as pop similar to our pop, like what we saw with list. So just remove the one or multiple random members from a set.
