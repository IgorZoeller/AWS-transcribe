 have sorted sets. So these are similar to sets, but they have an associated score. So when you add something, you use a zed add for this, but you put it you give it a score like here 112. And these are really great for leaderboards, or where you need to score things and sort that way. So column commands here would be things like zed add to add something with a with a certain score. zed rem is for removing zed range is when you want to return a range of elements in a sorted set score, zed rank would be returned the rank of a member in the sorted set score set sorted. So it's not giving you I said sort stored, but it's sorted. So it's not giving you its score, it's giving you where it's ranked within the list. And then you have zed score. And so that that you provide the the value and it would tell you what its score is. So those are all the data types that you should get some hands on with. There are some interesting ones like stream and things like that. But this is pretty much the core stuff for Redis. Redis is not hard to learn or use. So you just got to jump in there and use it. Okay.
