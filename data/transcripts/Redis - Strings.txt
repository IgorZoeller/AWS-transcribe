 take a look at our different types of data types data structures that we have available to us in a redis. The first is strings, the most basic one, the most important one, because everything is basically strings at the end of the day here in redis strings are binary safe, so they can contain data such as JPEG image, serialized Ruby objects. So they can represent different things, they can represent numbers, which is kind of odd. And strings have a max length of 512 megabytes to get a lot of room there. Often you're doing a get in the set here. So you say get, you know, get this key, you get back that string set this key with that value. So very simple to use. Strings can represent numbers. And so now you have these special functions for strings called atomic counters. So you can do things like increment, decrement, increment by certain amounts. So very, very clear here. So notice it is a string, but we can increment it and now return 11 and interprets it as an integer, which is interesting there. So the most common string commands would be things like get set a pen depend would just add something to the end of the string or check check if a string exists based on a key so exists you have
