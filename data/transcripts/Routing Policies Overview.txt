 So there are seven different types of routing policies available in route 53. And so I want to go over them here and then we will dive into them individually. So the first is simple routing. This is the default routing policy, where you have multiple addresses, address results that are randomly selected when being returned, you have weighted routing. So this routes traffic based on a weighted value to split the traffic, latency based routing, route traffic to your region resources, the lowest latency failover routing, so route traffic if the primary endpoint is unhealthy to the secondary endpoint, geolocation routing, so route traffic based on the location of your users, geo proximity routing, which sounds similar, but route traffic based on location of your resources and optionally shift traffic from resources in one location to resources and another multi value answer routing. So response to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random sounds very similar to simple routing, but we'll go over the differences when we look at that. Okay.
