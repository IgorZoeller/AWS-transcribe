 S3 batch operations performs large scale operations on Amazon s3 objects. And when we're talking about large scale, we're talking about exabytes of data. So what kind of operations can we perform quite a few we can do copies, we can invoke it as lambda functions, we can replace all object tags, replace ACLs, we can restore from s3 glacier, we can do object lock retention, we can put object lock legal holds on it. So a lot of stuff in order to perform a batch operation need to provide a list of objects in an s3 or supply an s3 inventory report manifest file. So having a manifest file is really useful, or having the SV file is useful as well. So you can have batch operations generated a completion report to audit the outcome of bulk operations. As far as I'm aware of this still does not have any functionality with a CLI or the SDK. So if you want to use this functionality, it's 100% click ops. But there you go.
