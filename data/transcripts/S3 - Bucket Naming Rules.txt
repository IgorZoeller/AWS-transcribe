 So when you go ahead and create a bucket, you're going to have to name it. And those buckets follow very strict rules in terms of how you need to name them. So s3 bucket names are similar to valid URL rules. But they actually have more rules. And this is because s3 bucket names are used to form URL links to perform various HTTPS operations. So an example of a bucket name here is my example bucket. And notice that it's being used as a sub domain on the Amazon AWS comm domain. So for whatever is valid for DNS or URLs, that's what has to be valid there. But let's go take a look at all the rules. So the first is length, you can have bucket names longer than 63 characters, but they have to be at least three characters long. But in terms of characters, you can only have lowercase numbers, dots and hyphens, everything else not allowed. For the start in the end, they must begin with a letter or a number. So you can't have any exotic things like a period or a hyphen in the front. For adjacent periods, you cannot have two periods side by side, so you can't go period period for IP address formats, they're just not allowed. So if you have something that looks like this, it's going to just say no. For restricted prefixes, you cannot have x n hyphen hyphen s three hyphen or s three hyphen configurator because they're used somewhere else where they're used, I have no idea but it does not want you to use them. As well as we have suffered suffixes that we're not allowed to use like s three alias, or o l s three. In terms of uniqueness, the names have to be unique across all AWS accounts in all AWS regions within a partition. In terms of where it says within a partition, who knows what partition it's in. The point is, is that it's like a domain name, when you have it, you have it and no one else can use it. In terms of ex exclusivity, a name can't be reused in the same partition until the original bucket is deleted. They keep talking about partitions. But the point is, is that if you have a bucket name, and delete it, now someone else can use it. In terms of transfer acceleration, they have one exception where you cannot have dots in the names. And when we cover s3 transfer acceleration, we'll cover that again. But the quickest summary or the easiest rules to remember is no uppercase, no underscores, no spaces in the bucket names. You remember those three things, it makes it very easy, everything else is pretty common sense. Other cloud services like Azure, everything is a domain name. So you're probably wondering, why are you making such a fuss about this, because it's not the norm in AWS to have these, these URL like names for, for naming resources. So I need to make extra emphasis on this one. But we'll look at some examples to really hit it home in the next slide here. Okay. Okay.
