 in s3, you're going to see this s3 bucket, your eye. And it is a way of referencing the address of an s3 bucket and s3 objects. And the way it looks like it starts with this protocol called s three colon, forward slash, forward slash, if you're used to seeing HPS, or file or other protocols, this one looks a little bit unusual. But the reason why that it was has is to make it easier to work with a CLI. So when you're doing like copy commands and things like that, you can quickly reference the the s3 bucket and its objects. It was has this other thing called arms Amazon resource names, and they're super long. So this is definitely a more convenient way where to use in other places. I'm not 100% sure. I just know for sure it shows up the CLI commands, some other things might use it. But yeah, that's all I really wanted you to know here is that it's called the s3 bucket your eye and it's just pointing to the bucket.
