 Let's talk about the AWS s3 CLI, because there's something a little bit different with this one, because s3 is such an old service and does so much that it doesn't just have one command, it has four different commands, we have the AWS s3 command, the s3 API command, the s3 control command, and the s3 outposts command. And I don't remember there being so many. But before there was just two, there was s3 s3 API. Now there's s3 control, that's real posts. So they all serve different purposes. And let's talk about it. The first one is it was s3, this is a high level way to interact with s3 buckets and objects. And so basically, this is like when you really don't want to do low level stuff, you just want to copy and move files, and you want it to put a lot of magic in there for you and write the least amount of code to do what you want it to do, you're going to use the AWS s3. So it's really good for day to day usage. I think that when you are programmatically working with bash scripts, you should really use the s3 API because it's more robust. And this one is a low level way to interact with s3 objects and buckets. And so here's an example of the exact same thing that at the AWS s3 is doing above there, as it's putting something in the bucket, but notice that it's a lot more verbose. So you have a lot more fine tuned control in terms of what is happening here. But yeah, it was s3 could be doing multiple things under the hood, whereas s3 API is really single action single focused, then you have s3 control. This one's a little bit confusing, because it has a lot of commands for s3 O posts, which I really would have thought that was what it was s3 O post would have been for. But s3 control is for access points, s3 O post buckets, s3 batch operation, storage lines. So a lot of the newer features are placed under here. And so here's an example of describing an s3 control job for something. I don't remember what but that's an example that then you have s3 O post, which doesn't really manage everything without posts, it just manages the endpoints for s3 O post. So there's very, very few in the CLI commands for this. So just understand that for the bulk of your normal operations, you're going to be using s3 control when it when it talks about buckets and things like that. And probably a mix of the other ones above there. But yeah, there you go for a good overview, a high level overview of the commands for AWS s3 CLI. In terms of sub commands, we'll talk about that. And we'll cover them throughout the s3 section. So that's why we're not covering them here. But yeah, we'll move on from here. Okay.
