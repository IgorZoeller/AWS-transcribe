 what is data consistency, this is when data is being kept in multiple places, and about whether the data exactly matches or does not match, hence the word consistency. We're talking about cloud, there are two terms you should know, which is strongly consistent, and eventually eventually consistent. Let's talk about what these things mean. So strongly consistent is every time you request data, you query data, you expect consistent data to be returned within a specified time. So we say one second, we'll come back in one second. So we will never return to you old data, but you'll have to wait at least two seconds for the query to return would be an example. Now let's talk about eventually consistent. So when you request data, you make it back inconsistent data within two seconds. So eventually it will be consistent is not consistent at the time of when you request it. So we are giving you whatever data is currently in the database, you will get a new data or old data. But if you wait a little bit longer, it will generally be up to date or consistent. So this really mattered back in the day when we're talking about s3, because some operations in s3 were consistent, or strongly consistent, some were eventually consistent. Now s3 offers strongly consistency for reads, writes and delete operations. So prior to 2020, it was not the case for all s3 operations. This is more or less all the operations, the operations that you care about the read the rights to deletes all the crud actions. So just remember that Amazon s3 offers strongly consistent or strong consistency for their s3 operations.
