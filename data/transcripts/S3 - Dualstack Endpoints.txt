 Well, let's talk about dual stack endpoints. So when you're accessing the Amazon s3 API, there are endpoints, but there's actually two possible endpoints that you can use for most general commands, I put an asterisk there, because there, of course, is more than two types of endpoints for Amazon s3. But there's two generic ones, for commands that we should know, the first is the standard endpoint, which looks like that looks pretty normal. This is for handling IPv4 traffic, and then you have a dual stack endpoint. And the key difference is it has the word dual stack as a sub domain, and it handles both IPv4 and IPv6. Why would we need to when when dual stack clearly does both? Well, at one point, all there was was the IP for for address. So the dual stack is designed to be the future replacement, as the IPv4 address space is running out and IPv6 has a larger public address space that we can pull from. So generally, you want to use the dual stack endpoint to future proof your apps. But of course, the standard one still works. I believe that the database CLI uses dual stack underneath. I'm not sure because you'd have to do a little bit of work to dig and find out. But I'm sure that at some point, if it decides that it has to do stack, they'll just update this a with CLI. And again, I want to point out that there are other s3 endpoints thing to things like static website, FIPS s3 controls access points. So there's of course other endpoints. But these are the two that are for the general commands like move, copy, make bucket things like that. Okay.
