 s3 event notifications allow your bucket to notify other AWS services about s3 event data. And that doesn't sound very impressive, we just say notifying them. But really, what's happening here is that you're have an easy way to do application integration from s3 to other services like lambda. And this is an extremely powerful service. This slide does not give it justice, but it's just hard to visualize it, at least here. But let's talk about the kind of notification events that s3 event notifications can listen to. So the we have things for new objects, object removals, restore objects, reduce redundancy storage if objects are lost, replication events, s3 lifecycle, expiration events, s3 lifecycle transition events, s3 intelligent tiering, auto automatic archival events, object tagging events, object ACL put events. And so anytime any of these things occur, what you can do is send them to other services like s&s, sq s lambda, and then event bridge. And when it goes into that bridge, it basically can do anything. Amazon s3 event notifications are designed to be delivered at least once notifications are delivered in seconds, but can sometimes take a minute or longer, we're going to spend a little bit more time in the labs on s3 event notifications because again, it's a super useful functionality here. But yeah.
