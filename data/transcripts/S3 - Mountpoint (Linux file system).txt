 Let's take a look at mount point for Amazon s3, which allows you to mount an s3 bucket to your Linux local file system. So mount point is an open source client that you install on your Linux OS and provides high throughput access to objects with basic file system operations. So mount points can read files up to five terabytes in size, listen, read existing files, create new files, mount points cannot and does not modify existing files, delete directories, support symbolic links, support file locking. So it's, again, it's very simplistic in terms of the type of access you're getting here. But it does give you some robustness there. You know, working with a Linux file system, which is nice. It can be used with the following storage classes, I'm actually surprised reduced, reduced redundancy storage is on there, because it's a legacy one. But I guess we could just kind of ignore that one. What I don't know is about s3, s3 Express one zone, because there's no information about it, because at the time of this video, that's a new storage class. And so we don't have information on that, I would think that it would let you do that. But it does have a special bucket type. So I'm not sure. But not too worried about that. Mount point is ideal for apps that don't need all features of a shared file system and post style permissions, but requires s3 elastic throughput to read and write large s3 datasets. So how are we going to use this? Well, the first thing is we're going to install mount point. And this is obviously going to vary based on what kind of links you're using. So this one is going to be based on using the Red Hat pack package manager. So whichever OS flavor supports that is going to utilize that like Red Hat or sent OS. And the way we're going to use the mount point is we're going to create a directory. And this is per line here. So we are creating our directory here, we're going to mount it to that, that new folder that we've created, we're going to go into that folder, we're going to perform whatever operations those basic operations we want to do. When we're done, we will unmount it, and that's it. So there you go.
