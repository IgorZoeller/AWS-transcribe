 multi region access points is a global endpoint to route requests to multiple buckets residing in different regions. So imagine you have two buckets, and you have bi directional replication on them, you can have whatever application you want on them. But usually, that's a good pairing with this. And you want to serve data that is going to provide the lowest latency. And so we have this customer that's from the US. But to make this diagram work, because I made a mistake, I shouldn't have called it us east one, I should have called it some other place. Let's just pretend that this person lives over the border, like on the border of Canada and the town across from his Montreal, it would make more sense to route them to CA central, that's where that is in Montreal than to us east one, which is in North Virginia. So that's what this can facilitate. If this sounds a lot like a bus global accelerator, that's because it is underneath that is what it's using. If you're not familiar with global accelerator, which we cover in networking sections, it basically is going to route things to the closest location. And so that is what it's utilizing underneath. And it's very common to use s replication rules alongside with multi region access points, because you generally are trying to give a copy of data somewhere else. And so bi directional or cross region replication is what you'll normally use with this. Okay.
