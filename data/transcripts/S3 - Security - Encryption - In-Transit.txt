 encryption in transit is when data is secure when moving between locations, and will utilize an algorithm such as TLS or SSL. So the encryption ensures that data remains confidential and cannot be intercepted or viewed by unauthorized parties while in transit. So imagine you have a PDF, you want to upload test rebucket, it'll get encrypted sender side with TLS, and then it'll get decrypted server side with TLS. Why would it just not keep the encryption until the person requests the file again? I don't know. I mean, it's just this, these protocols like TLS and SSL are not designed for server side long term encryption. All it's trying to do is to make sure that people cannot intercept the file. So yes, there is client side encryption. And so you might think, well, we'll just encrypt it. If somebody tries to get the file, they're not going to be able to decrypt it. But a better measure is that they're not being able to get it at all. And that is the point of encryption in transit. So there's two protocols that have been used. There's TLS. And so this is an encryption protocol for data integrity between two communicating computer applications. And so it used to be one and then 1.1. And those became no longer good to use. And so then SSL popped up. And then we had versions one, two, and three. And then it went back to TLS. And so now it's recommended to at least use 1.2. But the current best practice is 1.3. How do you specify TLS when you're sending files? I have no idea. I've never had to do it, it just happens. And so it's generally using TLS 1.3. But it was wants you to know that it to at least use 1.2. But you should use 1.3. So there you go. Alright, let's get a quick overview of the options for server side.
