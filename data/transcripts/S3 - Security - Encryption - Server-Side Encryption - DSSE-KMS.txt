 Well, let's talk about DSS e kms, which is dual layer server side encryption kms. It's basically SSC kms with the inclusion of client side encryption, I figured that it would make more sense to call this client side encryption kms. But they don't call it that because other cloud service providers use the term dual layer. So I'm thinking Amazon is following suit here. The reason why that doesn't make sense is that it's not encrypting twice server side. Okay, because one's happening client side and one's happening server side, but whatever, it's called dual layer server side. So the thing is, is that with DSS e kms data is encrypted twice. And they are the key used for the client side encryption comes from kms. This is kind of interesting because think of SSC see you generated locally, and then you send the key to a bus. But the way this works is that it sends you the key that they want you to use client side, and then you send the data and then encrypts it again. So that's a little bit different. There are no additional charges for DSS e and kms keys. And so here's an example on the right hand side where we would specify our server side encryption flag with a to best colon kms, colon DSS e, and then you're providing the kms key. But again, notice you aren't generating out a customer customer key and providing it because they're going to do that for you. So let's talk about because it's a little bit different. Let's talk about how encrypt and decrypt works. So the idea is that clients I request on a bus kms to generate a data encryption key. Using de k, using the customer managed key kms sends two versions of the deck to you a plain text version and an encrypted version, you use the plain text deck to encrypt your data locally and then discard it from memory. The encrypted version of the deck is stored alongside the encrypted data in Amazon s3. So hopefully that makes sense. If it doesn't give it another read. For decryption, you retrieve the encrypted data and the associated encrypted deck, you send the encrypted deck to AWS kms, which decrypts it using the corresponding customer managed key, cmk and returns the plain text deck, use the plain text deck to decrypt the data locally and then discard the deck from memory. The thing I just want you to remember is that with DSS e kms, you are not generating the key. AWS is doing all the work for you. Okay, so if you can't remember all the steps doesn't matter. Just remember that it's encrypted twice client side server side and the customer key or the client side key is going to come from a bus. Okay.
