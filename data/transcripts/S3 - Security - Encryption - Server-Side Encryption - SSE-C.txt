 Let us talk about SSE hyphen C, the C stands for customer because it's a customer managed key. This is when you provide your own encryption key that s3 then uses to apply AES to 1556 encryption to your data. So you need to provide the encryption key every time you retrieve objects. When you do provide it, s3 is not going to hold on to it, they're going to get rid of it after each request, you don't have to worry about that there is no additional charge to use SSE hyphen C, s s three will store a randomly salted hash based message authentication code on H Mac of your encryption key to validate future requests. So they don't hold on to the key, but they do make assault of it. So that future requests, they don't have to constantly have it around, right. So, in a sense, they do store, they don't start a key, but they store assault of the key. If that is, if that makes sense, you get pre signed URL support with SSE hyphen C. And the way you're going to generate out a key is just here's an example of Jerry out a encryption key using open SSL. And we're making sure that it's basic 64. And the example here is us using put object, and you can see that we're specifying specifying the AES to 56 encryption because that's what it uses. And then we provide the customer key. And it's as simple as that. So with bucket versioning, different object versions can be encrypted with different keys. So that's kind of important when you're working with object versioning. So if you're running into issues, not being able to decrypt your data, that's probably why you manage encryption keys on the client side, you manage any additional safeguards, such as key rotation on the client side. So at no cost, you can use SSE hyphen C, but it comes with a lot more maintenance on your end. Okay.
