 Let's take a look here at SSC s3. And this is where Amazon or AWS is managing all of the encryption for you. So s3 encrypts each object with a unique key. s3 uses envelope encryption, which all these methods are really using envelope encryption, s3 rotates the key regularly out for you automatically. So you don't have to do anything. By default, all objects will have SSE s3 applied unless you choose otherwise, there's no additional charge for using SSE s3. So it's a great option. And it's using the 256 bit advanced encryption standard. So you'll see it written as a yes GCM or as 256. And we'll see that exactly when we start using the it was CLI that when we specify the server side encryption flag, it wants a s 256. Now I did say that this is the default. So you don't actually even have to specify the the the flag server side encryption, if you don't provide it, it's still going to be a s e a s 256. So that is important to know, a bucket key can also be set for SSE s3 for improved performance. And we'll talk about that functionality of a bucket key, which sounds really confusing, because it sounds like we're talking about an object key for an object, but it's we're talking about bucket keys. And this is a security feature. And we'll talk about that in a separate slide on its own. Transcribed by https://otter.ai
