 and then we'll dive into each one. So server side inscription can be initialized to SSC. And this feature is always turned on for new objects. At one point, this was not the case where s3 was not server side encrypted, and you had to turn it on. But now it's always on, you don't have to worry about it, it's always going to be encrypted with SS SS e s3 by default. But this is where Amazon is managing the key for you. And it's encrypting using AES GCM. But usually you'll see it also typed in as AES 256. So understand there are some variations representing that algorithm there. Then we have SSE kms. So this is going to be using key management service. So you get, you know, FIPS compliance. And this is great if you need a certain level of regulatory compliance. And AWS is managing your keys, you have SSE, hyphen, C, this is where you are providing the key you generate it out and you upload it, but you now have to manage the rotation and things of it. Then you have DDS e kms, the sense for dual layer server side encryption. And the idea here is that you're encrypting the key or the data client side and then again server side. So there's two levels of or maybe it's the key. But anyway, we'll talk about in that slide because I have all the information there. But the idea is that there's two layers of encryption there. And then the other thing I want to point out is that server side encryption only encrypts the contents of an object and not its metadata. So that's very important to understand. But let's go dive deeper into each of these encryption options. Okay.
