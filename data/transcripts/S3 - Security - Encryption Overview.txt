 let us get a quick overview of the s3 encryption options here. And then we're going to dive into each one. So the first is encryption transit. So this is when data is encrypted by the sender, and then decrypted by the receiver. It's to prevent people from intercepting files, even if they're encrypted, we don't want them to even get the encrypted files. And that's what encryption transit does. We have encryption at rest, there's two different options here, we have client side encryption, CSC, this is when the data is encrypted by the client and then sent to the server sounds kind of like encryption transit a, the client has the key, the server will serve the encrypted file, since it does not have the key to decrypt when the data is requested. So the idea is that the we're doing client side encryption, but the server can never decrypt the file, okay, then you have server side encryption, SSC, when the data is encrypted by the server. So the server has the key to decrypt when the data is requested. So those are those three broad options. And we will now go dive into each one of these. Okay.
