 atabus provides more than one way to make sure that you're not having open buckets to the internet. Well, I am access analyzer for s3 is that other service. So it will alert you when your s3 buckets are exposed to the internet or other atabus services. So the idea is that when this service is running, it's going to tell you so there's an example of a bucket that has a bucket policy. And it's telling me, you know, if it's active, and what can be done with it, in order to use the access analyzer for s3, you need to first create the analyzer in im access analyzer at the count level. And just notice here, it says 10 buckets are configured to allow access to anyone on the internet. So that's kind of the warning that you would get saying, hey, you have 10 buckets, you might want to go and investigate. And you can view the buckets per region here and then download the reports to get more information. Very straightforward and simple service, but super good to quickly find out where you might have vulnerabilities.
