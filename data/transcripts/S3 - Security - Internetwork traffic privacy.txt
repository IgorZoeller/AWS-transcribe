 Let us talk about inter network traffic privacy. This is not a specific feature to AWS, but it's just a concept in security. So what is inter network traffic privacy, this is about keeping data private as it travels across different networks. And usually the idea here is that when we're talking about cloud, it's about keeping the traffic within the like AWS network, you know, the Azure network, the GCP network internally. So it never goes out to the internet, and it's going to benefit from the cloud service providers, security measures, and things like that. So there are two ways that we can have inter network traffic privacy when we're talking about s3. The first is a bus private link. So this is also known as VPC interface endpoints. I'm not sure if it was called VPC interface endpoints, and then renamed to a bus private link. But we do talk about these in our networking section in more detail. But I'm just trying to remind you in this part, what these things do. So for VPC interface endpoints, this allows you to connect an ENI elastic network interface directly to other end of a services like s3, EC two and lambda, it can connect to select third party services via the AWS marketplace. And it was private link can go cross account. It has fine grained permissions via VPC endpoint policies. There is a charge for using a bus private link. So it's not free, but it's extremely robust utility, or networking networking feature to keep your traffic private and internal within the within the AWS network. So next we have is VPC gateway endpoints. So this allows you to connect a VPC directly to s3 or DynamoDB. Staying private with the internal AWS network, VPC gateway endpoints cannot go cross account. It does not have fine grained permissions. And there is no charge to use VPC gateway endpoints. So when you can use VPC gateway endpoints, when it makes sense for your use case, because it is free, whereas VP, AWS private link, or VPC interface endpoints, they can add up pretty quickly. And yeah, I know I missed the s on there. But what what can you do about it? Okay, we'll see you in the next one. Ciao
