 S3 glacier instant retrieval is a storage class designed for rarely access data that still needs immediate access in performance sensitive use cases, because normally, when you use S3 glacier, it's for archival storage. And so the assumption is you're not going to have it immediately accessible. So this is a very special class. It has 11 nines out of durability. I've said this repeatedly. But at the time of making this video, all storage classes have 11 nines of durability. This has three nines of availability, just like standard IA, so not four nines, but three nines, its cost effectiveness is 68% lower than standard AI that's crazy low. It's great for long lived data that is accessed once per quarter. So again, there's retrieval fees, just like how standard IA, you only want to access it once per month, this one you want to access it. The files once per quarter or not at all. The retrieval time is within milliseconds. So it's super fast. This is really great when you need rarely access data that needs immediate access, image hosting, online file sharing applications, medical imaging and health records, news media assets, satellite and aerial images. The way the pricing works is you have storage per gigabyte per request, there is a retrieval fee, we're going to assume that the retrieval fee is more expensive than standard IA because it makes more sense. It has a minimum storage duration of 90 days. So understand that, you know, that's an additional thing you have to consider in terms of costs that you're going to be at least charged 90 days for an object that is placed in there. I need to point out that glacier instant retrieval is not a separate service and does not require a vault just to make that clear between S3 glacier vault and these S3 storage classes that have the word glacier in them.
