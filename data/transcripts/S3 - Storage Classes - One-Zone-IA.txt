 are taking a look at one zone I a storage class, which is designed for the data that is less frequently accessed and has additional savings that reduce availability knows the name it says one zone and I a there's two other storage classes that one has one zone in the name and one has I in the name. If you understand those two components, you know exactly what this class is going to do. It has a high durability of 11 nines, as all sorts classes have it for whatever reason, it has a lower availability than standard and standard I a. So standard I a has three nines because it's infrequently access. So of course, it's going to have lower availability. This one's even lower because it only runs in a single zone, fewer zones, fewer availability. That's why they call it availability zones. The storage effective, or the cost effective storage here is 20% less than standard I a. I don't think I made a good enough emphasis on it in the last in the last one we talked about standard I a standard I a is 50% less than standard. And then this one is 20% less than standard I a so even even more cost effective for data redundancy data stored in one availability zone. So if there was a disaster in that AZ, you lose all your data. So you might want to do cross region replication if the data is super important to you. But then again, you're kind of getting the territory of having standard I a where it's going to be in multiple AZs. But in another region, of course, that'd be a bit different, I think. So retrieval time is within milliseconds, even though it says one's under the name, this is not expressed. So it's not going to be single digit milliseconds, it's just as fast as standard and standard I a, the use cases here is ideal for secondary backup copies of on premise data for storing data that can be recreated in the event of an AZ failure is also suitable for storing infrequently access data that is non mission critical for pricing. We have storage per gigabyte per request. There's a retrieval fee, and it has a minimum day charge of 30 days. I do. Yeah, that's about it. So there we go.
