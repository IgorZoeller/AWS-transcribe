 reduce redundancy storage is a legacy storage class to store non critical reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon s3 storage. So this was introduced back in 2010. And at the time, it was cheaper than standard storage for that reduction in redundancy, which means that you know, if if there was an issue, you could end up losing your data. So that's why they say storing non critical data. However, since 2018, something has changed within Ada buses infrastructure where s3 standard is now cheaper than using RRS. And I think that people thought that they had some kind of similar infrastructure or architectures. But when this happened, clearly RRS was architected a completely different way than s3. And it doesn't seem like it's ever going to become cheaper. And so basically, it's not really recommended to use RS. And it has no fit in any of the modern storage use cases, because it's never going to be cheaper. Now it's still available in the actual AWS console, because some legacy customers probably still have objects stored in there. And it's really hard for us to get rid of features. But you're not supposed to use RS, I don't have the exams will focus on it. But just in case you ever hear the term RS, you know what I'm talking about, you understand that is a legacy storage class. Okay.
