 let's take a look here at our first storage class, which is s3 standard. And it's the default storage class when you upload to s3 without specifying particular storage class, it's designed for general purpose storage for frequently accessed data, it has a durability of 11 nines, I'm going to tell you right now all the storage classes have a durability of 11 nines, which is interesting because some storage classes are one zone. So they have fewer availability zones, meaning like they're in fewer locations, but they still have 11 nines because in terms of durability, AWS is going to make multiple copies even in a single AZ and so that's how we can have 11 nines of durability. For availability, it has four nines of availability. So it's it's quite highly available compared to the rest of the storage classes. For redundancy, it's stored in three or more availability zones. And I do believe that they make additional copies even within an AZ for retrieval time, it's within milliseconds, it's not the fastest. So when we say milliseconds, you know, milliseconds can go up to 1000 or less, right? So 1000 equals a second. So understand that could be three digit, two digit, even one digit, but there is a specific class that is a single digit retrieval time, which is that new class. For throughput, it's optimized for frequently accessed data. And or if you require real time access for scalability, it can scale no problem to any number of requests, its use cases, it's ideal for a wide range of things. Again, we said this is general purpose, so we don't have to name them all. But you know, basically, if you don't know to do standard is totally fine. The way pricing works for this is you pay per storage of gigabyte per request, there is no retrieval fee where some storage classes, it's going to cost to retrieve the data. And there's no minimum storage duration. So you can store things in here and delete them whenever you want. Okay.
