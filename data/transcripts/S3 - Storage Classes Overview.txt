 Let's take a look here at s3 storage classes as there are quite a few for s3. So it was offers a range of s3 storage classes that trade retrieval time, accessibility, durability, and cheaper storage. The idea is the lower down we go on this slide here, the cheaper the service should get, I put a big asterisk there because it's going to be really dependent on your use case, as you know, in some cases, it could be more or less depending on how you're using these storage classes. The first one and the most important one for you to know is the s3 standard, which is the default class whenever you create an s3 bucket, it's going to be this one, it's fast, it's available, it's durable. So there's not a lot to say about it. But it is a solid bucket when you are not sure, you know how you plan on utilizing your storage. Okay, the next one is s3 reduce redundancy storage, and you're going to notice that it's grayed out because this is a legacy storage class. The purpose of this storage class was to give you a reduced cost of s3 standard by having less redundancy in storage. However, s3 standard has come down in cost over time. And so this one doesn't really fit any kind of modern storage scenario. But it still is something you can select in the eight of us console at least for now, but you really should not be using it. Then we have s3 intelligent tiering. So this uses machine learning to analyze the object usage and determine the storage class. This is great if you have a lot of objects that are not being optimized. And if you don't mind being charged an additional fee to analyze the objects, then it could definitely save you money. The next one is s3 Express one zone. So this provides a single digit millisecond performance. So it's super fast. It has its own special bucket type, it only operates in one availability zone. That's why it's called one zone. And it's 50% less than standard cost. So I imagine because it's only in one availability zone, that availability zone gets blown away, you could lose your data. So there might be some sensitivities around that we have s3 standard ia. So the ia is for infrequent access. Anytime you see ia, you should think that there is an additional retrieval fee because there always is. It's fast, just as fast as s3 standard, but it's cheaper if you're not going to be accessing your data often. So they suggest, I think it's like if it's less than once a month, then you're going to end up saving money in being in standard ia. So it's not exactly archiving, but it's some somewhere in between, there is an extra fee to retrieve, it's 30% less than standard. And the difference is, of course, you have reduced availability. That's why it has ia in the name, you have s31 zone ia. So this one is going to only be in a single AZ, just like Express one zone, but it's also ia. So it's infrequently access. So the idea is that it's even cheaper than standard ia by 20% less, of course, it's going to have reduced durability, so your data could get destroyed. So you know, again, make sure that it makes sense for the type of files that you have. And there is of course, an extra fee to retrieve, then we're going to s3 glacier. So we have a whole section s3 glacier, because it's a little bit more complicated than that kind of feels like its own service. But the idea is that you have, well, eight of us now has three storage classes for it, we have s3 glacier, instant retrieval, flexible retrieval, and then deep archive, a lot of times we'll group instant and flexible together as one thing. And we'll probably do that in some other future slides. So if it just as s3 glacier, just assume we're talking about instant and flexible. Even within these tiers, like look at flexible retrieval, deep archive, you can break it down to standard expedited and block retrieval. And that's going to determine how fast you want to get back those files in those tiers, as well as how much you want to pay because the faster, the more you're going to pay for that retrieval cost. So that'll make more sense. And we go more deep into those sections, then a bus outposts for s3 has its own storage class outposts is exotic offering that it has where you can have hardware and software within your own data center. So they bring the racks to you where the servers there with all the software pre pre loaded, but it's not like the full version of what you get in it was cloud. So there are going to be limitations and differences there. But yeah, there you go.
