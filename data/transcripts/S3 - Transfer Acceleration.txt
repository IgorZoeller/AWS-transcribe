 Let's take a look here at s3 transfer acceleration, which is a bucket level feature that provides fast and secure transfer files over long distances between your end users and your bucket. And the way we're going to do this is by utilizing CloudFront edge locations to quickly enter the Amazon global network. So we aren't actually directly uploading to the standard endpoint, we're going to be using a distinct endpoint, which is this s three hyphen accelerate, they have a dual stack version of it, of course, use the dual stack one because that supports both ipv4 and ipv6. When you can, now I need to point out that s3 transfer acceleration only supports virtual hosted style requests. So we'll need to configure that before we use that buckets cannot contain periods for whatever reason. And it can take up to 20 minutes after transfer acceleration is enabled in order for this to take effect. So how are we gonna use it, it's very straightforward, what we're going to do is enable transfer acceleration on the bucket. So make sure that feature is turned on. And then what we can do is globally configure virtual hosted style requests so that everything after that is going to utilize that there. And then we're going to specify the endpoint URL. So there, I'm just putting the standard endpoint in there. And so it will utilize that during upload, if we want to always set the accelerated endpoint, and I'll have to supplies the endpoint URL every single time. We can also globally set that as well. But there you go.
