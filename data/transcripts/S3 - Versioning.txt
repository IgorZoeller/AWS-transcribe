 talk about s3 versioning, which allows you to store multiple versions of an s3 object. So the idea here is with versioning, you can recover more easily from unintended user actions and application failures. And versioning enabled buckets can help you recover objects from accidental deletion, or if someone attempts to overwrite a file. So the idea here is we store all versions of an object in s3 at the same object key address. By default, s3 versioning is disabled on buckets, and you must explicitly enable it, it was will always recommend for you to use s3 versioning. But you got to understand once you enable it, you cannot disable it only suspend, you can only suspend versioning on a bucket. So it fully integrates with s3 lifecycle rules. MFA delete feature provides an additional level of protection against deletion of your data, something we definitely need to know for the exam is f MFA delete. But anyway, buckets can be in three different states with s3 versioning, you you have unversioned. So that means you don't have it turned on. It's versioned. So it's turned on or it's version suspended. So you have suspended future versions of it. So those three states of it. Let's go take a look at how s3 versioning works with objects.
