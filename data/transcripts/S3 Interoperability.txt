 interrupt ability. And the term interrupt ability, if you've never heard it before, in the context of cloud services is the capability of cloud services to exchange and utilize information seamlessly with each other. So the idea with interrupt ability is that it's just it's very easy there. There's no intermediate application integration service that does it, it just works. And the reason we don't cover all these functionalities in this s3 section is that we cover them in the respective service that has an integration with it. So I kind of wanted make sure that you understand that there's a lot more going on with s3 than just what's in this s3 section. But here are examples of it have services that have interrupt ability. And that's by them dumping data to s3 or doing something otherwise. And it's not a complete list. It's just an example of popular services that are working with that three. The first is easy to so it stores snapshots and backups and s3 rds stores backups and data exports to s3 cloud trail stores API call logs in s3 cloudwatch logs export logs metrics to s3 it was lambda outputs data logs to s3 it was glue. It stores its ETL results in s3 for kinesis. When we're talking about data streaming, it can dump data from firehose to s3. So there's a service called kinesis firehose. And so they can stream to s3 or the results to it. EMR so uses s3 for input output data storage, redshift it unloads data s3. It was data pipeline moves transforms data to and from s3. Amazon Athena outputs query results to s3. It was IOT core stores IoT data and s3. If you are taking any kind of data related certification, they really want you to know the interoperability between services. So make sure you understand the limitations and restrictions or what can and cannot be moved to and from with that's three and other services. Okay.
