 storage class analysis allows you to analyze storage access patterns of objects within a bucket to recommend objects to move between standard to standard AI. This is kind of interesting because obviously we have s3 intelligent tiering and we also have lifecycle rules. But understand that all this does is is analyze and then give you recommendations. You can easily turn this on via the API. This is going to observe the infrequent access patterns of a filtered set of data over a period of time, you can add multiple analysis filters per bucket up to 1000 filters, the results can be exported to CSV export, exporting the daily usage to necessary bucket and using Amazon QuickSight for data visualization, provide storage usage visualizations in the s3 console that are updated daily. After a filter is applied, the analysis will be available 24 to 48 hours later, storage class analysis will analyze objects for three days or longer to gain enough information. Why would you use this if you have s3 intelligent tearing, because this is a manual process, and it's more cost effective. And it's not for moving between a bunch of tears, it's just for these top two tiers here, you could pair this with lifecycle rules to kind of automate that process. And you also get some additional metrics. So that's pretty much it. But yeah, there's a lot of services out there that have overlapping responsibilities, but it usually comes down to cost automation, convenience and things like that. Okay.
