 Amazon S3 storage lens is a storage analysis tool for S3 buckets across your entire AWS organization. It can do things like determine how much storage you have across your organization, which are the fastest growing buckets and prefixes, identify cost optimization opportunities, implement data protection and access management best practices, improve the performance of application workloads, metrics can be exported as CSV or parquet to another S3 bucket, usage metrics can be exported to Amazon CloudWatch. And the way it kind of works is that it's going to aggregate these metrics and displays into an account snapshot as an interactive dashboard, and it's updated daily. So when I went to the service, it was already on, I remember turning it on, maybe it was on by default, I can't remember. But you have all these tabs across the top. And every single one has all these cool metrics and diagrams and stuff like that. It's very straightforward. It's just a bunch of metrics. Okay.
