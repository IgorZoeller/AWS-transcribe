 Hey, this is Andrew Brown and we are taking a look at SNS. So SNS stands for simple notification service. It's a highly available, durable, secure and fully managed pub sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices distributed systems and serverless applications. Here is the general view of it, we have publishers who will send the messages, the topics which are logical access points for communication, and the subscribers. Sometimes we'll see publishers called sources and the subscribers destinations, but this is pretty much the setup here. So there you go.
