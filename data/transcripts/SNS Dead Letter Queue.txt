 Alright, let's talk about dead letter queue for SNS, we talked about dead letter queues more in SQS, but SQS or SNS has the option to send to a dead letter queue, it will send failed message attempts to SQS queue. When you are configuring this, the standard SNS topic sends to the standard SQS queue, if you have a first in first out SNS topic, it has to send to the first in first out SQS queue. To configure an SNS topic to send to a DQL, you're going to use the set description attributes. So you're going to set a read drive policy, because that's what you're actually doing. And you're going to specify the arm for the dead letter queue, a queue policy will need to be configured to allow us an S to send events to the S S SQS queue, which it says there. So yeah, there you go.
