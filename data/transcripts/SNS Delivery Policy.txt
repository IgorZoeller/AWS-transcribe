 SNS delivery policy defines how SNS retries the delivery messages when server side errors occur, each delivery protocol has its own delivery policy. So when the message policy is exhausted, SNS stops retrying the delivery and discards the message, unless a dead letter queue is attached to the subscription. So here we have a bunch of places where we're working with SNS. And it's going to be a little bit different for some of these. So for the retry phase, it will try three times without delay. For the other services, it'll try zero times though delay for pre back off phase, it's two times one second apart. And for the other services here is two times for 10 seconds apart. For the back off phase. It's 10 times with exponential back off from one second to 20 seconds. For the other, it's 10 times with exponential back off from 10 seconds to 600 seconds. For the post back off phase, it's 100,000 times for 20 seconds apart. And then for the other ones, it's 38 times 600, which is 600 seconds, so 10 minutes apart, I want to point out here that these appear to be a two A's, I should never notice this till now. But these are a two A's. And these are a two P's to person. So I mean, what I get, I'd say so for all those. So that makes sense to me. The data policies cannot be changed with the exception of HTTPS. So this is how they are. So you can set your own delivery policy for HTTPS endpoints, as we just said, that was the exception was HTTPS endpoints. So if we want to do that here, we we set our delivery policy here. And so there's our example, there are four options for backup functions. So we have error, error, I never use that word, arithmetic, like, you know, adding exponential, geometric, and linear that set here, that changes like how it backs off. Okay, so there you go.
