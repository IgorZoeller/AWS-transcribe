 All right, so SNS has destinations, these are the subscribers who can receive messages. And it was like to categorize these in two ways. We have application to application, also known as a to a, which I think they made up to be honest, support subscribers from it have a services of web apps. So things going to data, firehose, lambda functions, SQL, SQL, HTTPS endpoints, it was event for pipelines, that you have application to person or a to p supports subscribers from human entities. So mobile apps, mobile phones, email addresses, chatbots, or pager duty. So hopefully that gives you an idea. And again, source is publisher destination is the receiver Okay, or subscriber.
