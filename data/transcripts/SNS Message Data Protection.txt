 message data protection safeguards the data that's published to your SNS topic by using data protection policies to audit mass redact or block the sensitive information that moves between apps and AWS services. It scans for PP personally identifiable information p II's, I was gonna say PPI, but it's p II's protected health information. So p H is via data identifiers, you can choose to use predefined data identifiers like name, address, credit card numbers, or you can create your own data identifiers. It supports the following actions it can audit so audit up to 99% of the data publish, then send findings to CloudWatch, three data firehose, why won't do 100% I don't know but apparently 99% is what it can do. de identify some mask or redact data deny so block data from being sent messages. Message data protection can help reduce financial legal regulatory risks by complying with privacy regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, PCI FedRAMP, message data protection is only supported for standard SNS topics. So let's take a look at how this is implemented. The idea is we'll put a data protection policy in our policy document here, you can see that we have an operation we're performing, which is the de identify and we are telling it to mask mask the characters with a pound here. And you can see the data identifier we're using is the predefined one where we are saying let's mask credit cards using pounds. So there you go.
