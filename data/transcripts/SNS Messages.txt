 Let's take a look here at publishing messages. And the most common way to work with SMS is by having your app programmatically published messages to SMS topic, this is pretty much the main way we're going to work with it. So here we have a Ruby example, I'm just gonna get my pen tool out here. So we can take a quick look here, we're establishing a client, we're including the SDK up here for SMS, we have our topic, our and we have our message. And we're just going to publish it to that topic or with a message, it's pretty straightforward. If you have larger messages, you'll have to use a library called the SNS extended client library for Java or Python. Originally, this was only for Java. Obviously, not everybody wants to use Java. So now it's available also in Python, which can be found on AWS labs, forward slash Amazon, SNS, Python, extended client lib on GitHub. So here's an example of it. There's a lot more a lot more going on here, I would say, because you'll have to do this through s3. But the way it works is these libraries are useful for messages that are larger than the current 256 k kilobyte message up to a maximum of two gigabytes. So understand that the standard messaging is 256 kilobytes, kilobytes. Yeah, so I was gonna say bits. Both libraries save the actual payload to the S3 bucket and publish the reference of the stored s3 object to the SNS topic. We have message attributes. So this allows you to provide structured metadata items about the message. So here's an example of this publishing a message now utilizing the CLI as opposed to the SDK. And so we have message attributes that were passed along here. So the supported data types here are string string array, number binary. So yeah, just additional information we can pass along, we can do batch processing. So here we are publishing multiple messages at the same time. And actually, we're doing up to 10, which is what we can do. So any messages in batches can help reduce the SMS costs by factor of 10. Because you can send up to 10 at a time together. If you want to send different messages to different kinds of subscribers, set message structure to JSON and supply a JSON file as the message. So the idea here is that we might have different types of protocols that we're trying to service, but we want it to be different for each one. So this is the default, this is what email would say this is what SMS would say this is what SQS would say. So there's variation there. But there you go.
