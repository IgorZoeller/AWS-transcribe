 Before we jump into SNS, let's make sure we understand what pub sub is a pub sub is the publish subscribe pattern commonly implemented in messaging systems in pub sub systems, the sender of the messages, the publishers does not send their messages directly to receivers, they instead send their messages to an event bus and the event bus categorizes their messages into groups, then receivers of messages, which we can call subscribers subscribe to these groups, whenever new messages appear within the description, the messages are immediately delivered to them. So here's an example. A simple example of an event bus with publishers and subscribers. Sometimes these are called other things like sources and destinations, and you'll see some variations. For these terms, publishers have no knowledge of who their subscribers are subscribers do not pull for messages, messages are instead automatically immediately pushed to subscribers. messages and events are interchangeable terms in pub sub use case here could be something like a real time chat system or a web hook system. So there you go.
