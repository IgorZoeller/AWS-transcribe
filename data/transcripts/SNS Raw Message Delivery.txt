 SNS has a feature called raw message delivery, which avoids having Amazon data firehose, SQS, HBS endpoints process the JSON formatting of messages. So the idea is that when you set the description attributes, you can set the attribute name as raw message delivery and set that value raw message delivery to true data firehose and SQS metadata is stripped from published messages and the messages sent as is for HP endpoints, the HTTP header x Amazon SNS raw delivery value is set to true indicating the message should should not be formatted. So for web applications, you have to pick up on that header to know the state of it. Okay.
