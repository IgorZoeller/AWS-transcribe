 Alright, let's take a look here at subscription. So to receive messages from a topic, you need to create a subscription, a subscription can only subscribe to one protocol. And one topic, you can make lots of descriptions, but you are limited in that regard. When you choose to create a subscription, you're going to choose a protocol. And we have quite a few options. So we have HTTPS for web hooks, email, which is good for internal email notification, though it only supports plain text, email Jason, so send your JSON via email, Amazon SQS, AWS lambda, which I think is called that Amazon lambda, I always forget if it's AWS or Amazon lambda these days, SMS, which is a text message, or platform application endpoints, so you can push it out to mobile devices. So there you go.
