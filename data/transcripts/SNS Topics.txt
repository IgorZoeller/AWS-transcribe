 Alright, let's take a look here at topics. So topics allow you to group multiple subscriptions together, a topic is able to deliver to multiple protocols at once. When topics deliver messages to subscribers, it will automatically format your message according to the subscribers chosen protocol. You can also encrypt topics via KMS. Publishers don't care about the subscribers protocol. Subscribers listen for incoming messages. And here's how we would actually create cues, or sorry, I should not cues, topics, sorry. There are two types of SNS topics, we have standard and first in first out. The main difference is first in first out guarantees the order of messages. So if you want to create a first in first out topic, it's very similar, except you're going to set the attributes to be top FIFO topic equals true. And apparently, you have to have the name of the topic to have period FIFO on the end. So that's how that's going to work. Let's do a comparison between standard and first in first out. So for throughput, standard as high throughput for first in first out, it has lower throughput compared to standard. For delivery it for standard, it's at least once. And there's possible duplicates. For first in first out, you only get one and there are no duplicates for ordering. There's no ordering guarantee for first in first out messages are delivered in the order they are sent within a message group. That's why it's called first in first out. The use case here would be for standard, where the volume messages is high and the exact order ordering is not critical. So alerts, notifications for first in first out. This is where the ordering is crucial. So banking transactions, order data processing for messaging groups. We don't have those for standard for first in first out supports messaging groups allowing multiple ordered streams within the same topic. So there you go.
