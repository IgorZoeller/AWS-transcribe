 So we're talking about share VPCs. But this is actually for a very specific service, which allows you to share a lot of things other than VPCs. And technically, we're not sharing VPCs, we're sharing subnets. But I wanted to give this a good feature in the course, because it is such a useful service. So it was resource access manager, also known as RAM allows you to share resources across your AWS accounts. So VPCs can be shared with other AWS accounts within the same region to centrally manage resources in a single VPC. Using a shared VPC allows you to reduce the number of VPCs that you create and manage separate accounts for billing and access controls. If you want to utilize this feature, you got to turn it on. Using the RAM API for your AWS organization, you share VPCs by sharing subnets. I know confusing, but that's how it works. You can share only non default subnets, which I think that's the case. I actually accidentally deleted my default sub VPC. So I'm not 100% sure. But that's what the doc say is that it's non default subnets, you need to create a resource share in RAM. So what you're sharing, you need to create a shared principles in RAM. So who you plan to share with. And once you have shared that VPC, if you go to the account that you're sharing with, it will just look like a normal VPC. It'll appear there. And if you go into the VPC, it'll actually tell you who the owner is. So you have a clear idea how that works. So there you go.
