 When you send an API request to AWS, you have to sign the request, because that's going to identify who sent the request data. So signatures do two things, it prevents data tampering, and it verifies the identity of the requester. Just so you know, when you're using the CLI or SDK requests are signed for you automatically, the only time that you would be assigning requests manually is that if you're using the API directly through HTTP, as I said before, I in general use, you do not want to do that unless you have to for some very specific use case because you cannot use it SDK or CLI. Just so you know that not every single request requires signing. So for Amazon s3, there is a anonymous request, like say when you have a public bucket, and you just want people to be able to read files from it. And there are some API operations, such as assume roll with web identity where you're just not going to be passing on sign requests, because that is SCS is for used for getting credentials. So at that point, you wouldn't have any credentials to sign with, so to speak. Here is an example of a signature being used. And so this example is for or within a query parameter, there's a few different ways you can specify it. But that's where it would go. And so when you use s3, or other services, and you expect URLs, you're definitely going to see the signatures there. And that's what it is. It was has two different protocols for signing version two, which is the old one, nobody uses this anymore. And then we have version four, let's just take a quick look at how to sign on version four. So we just have a general idea how it works. Okay.
