 simple routing policies are the most basic routing policy route 123. And these are going to be the default policy when you're creating them via the database management console. The idea here is you have one record and provide multiple IP addresses. When multiple values are specified for record roughly three will return all values back to the user in a random order. So basically, you know, if you have a domain, you're saying www.exampro.co, it's going to pick one at random. And here is what the implementation would look like, you get my pen tool out here, so we can just look closer. So notice, we have our a record type here, which is, you can use this with other things, but we're just using it with an A record. And notice that here we have our resource records, and we just provide them. So there's no other additional option. That's just the default option. So we're not saying like this is simple. It's just that if we use the resource records here, it's going to be a simple policy. Okay.
