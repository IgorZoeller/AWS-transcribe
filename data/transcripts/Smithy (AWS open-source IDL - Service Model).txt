 Smithy 2.0 is AWS open source interface definition language IDL for web services, and it is a language for defining services and SDKs. Smithy and its server generator unlocks model first development and forces you to find your interface first rather than let your API become implicitly defined by your implementations choices. So here is an example of this language. And so this is kind of like a mock example of how it would be used for s3. Why am I showing you Smithy, I just want you to know how these tools are built out. And that's the the SDK, the the Python SDK uses something called service models. And we'll look at that in any other slides somewhere in this course. But it's basically will be a JSON file. And that JSON file is based off what this language defines it to be. Will this ever show up on any exam? Absolutely not. But why would I show it to you so you can understand how these tools are built. And maybe when if for whatever reason, the future you have to go digging in and change out a service model, you might remember Smithy, and then that will lead you on the right path. Okay.
